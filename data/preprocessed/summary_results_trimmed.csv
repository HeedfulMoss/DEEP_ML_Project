Service:  General Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with
a history of alcohol abuse and atrial fibrillation who was
found down by a neighbor on [**2166-5-30**] and subsequently
taken to the [**Hospital3 8834**] Emergency Department
for further evaluation and management.

At [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital, the patient received a full trauma
workup including a cervical spine film demonstrating
degenerative joint disease, a computed tomography of the
pelvis which demonstrated a right acetabular fracture, and
head computed tomography which revealed a bilateral subdural
hematoma right and subacute.

At baseline, the patient reportedly oriented times one (per
his daughter) and was noted to be similarly oriented in the
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital Emergency Department.  By report, the
patient was also noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and
was subsequently begun on a diltiazem drip prior to transfer
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Alcohol abuse with a history of associated withdrawal
seizures.
4.  Status post bilateral cataract surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Home medications included
Coumadin, digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, Flomax, and atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  An extensive past smoking history.  A
history of alcohol abuse.  A history of intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on arrival to the Emergency Department revealed blood
pressure was 130/86, heart rate was 79, respiratory rate was
27, and oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 liters.  The patient's
general examination revealed an elderly gentleman in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed no jugular venous distention.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  No lymphadenopathy.  The neck was
noted to be stiff without tenderness at the midline.  Pupils
were noted to be equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation with surgical changes.  Extraocular movements
were noted to be intact.  Cardiovascular examination
demonstrated an irregularly irregular heart rate with normal
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  Respiratory
examination demonstrated diffuse expiratory wheezes
bilaterally.  The patient's abdomen was noted to be soft and
distended with positive bowel sounds.  Tenderness in the
right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant.  No rebound was
noted, but voluntary guarding was noted.  Extremity
examination demonstrated warm and well perfused extremities,
and no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic
examination demonstrated cranial nerves II through XII were
grossly intact.  Strength was noted to be [**5-26**] bilaterally.
The patient was noted to be oriented times one with
cerebellar ataxia.  Deep tendon reflexes were noted to be 1+
in all extremities.  The toes were downgoing.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies on admission revealed sodium was 128, potassium was
4.5, chloride was 86, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen
was 27, creatinine was 1.3, and blood glucose was 121.  White
blood cell count was 21.8, hematocrit was 35.9, and platelets
were 199.  Creatine kinase was 1395.  MB was 24.  MB index
was noted to be 1.7.  Troponin was less than 0.3.  Calcium
was 9.1, magnesium was 1.9, and phosphate was 3.3.
Prothrombin time was 14.8, partial thromboplastin time was
29, and INR was 1.4.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the
head demonstrated a small right parietal subdural hematoma
and right cerebellar encephalomalacic changes; consistent
with chronic microvascular infarction.

A computed tomography of the pelvis and abdomen demonstrated
a colonic adhesion versus stricture with acute narrowing at
the splenic flexure and proximal colonic dilatation as well
as a comminuted/horizontal fracture of the right acetabular
roof and associated hematoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2166-5-31**] the patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit under the direction of Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained.  Given the nature
of the patient's imaging studies, it was believed that his
hematoma represented a subacute event, and close monitoring
was recommended.

An Orthopaedic consultation was also obtained to evaluate the
patient's acetabular fracture.  Initial recommendations
advised conservative management with knee immobilization and
posterior dislocation precautions with nonweightbearing
status and close clinical monitoring with plans for
consideration of operative repair.

The patient was continued on intravenous diltiazem to achieve
rate control for his rapid atrial fibrillation with good
success.  An initial evaluative electrocardiogram was
obtained which demonstrated 1-mm ST dep","42731, 4280","Atrial fibrillation; Congestive heart failure, unspecified",2

History of Present Illness:
  Ms. [**Known lastname 4553**] is a 63 yo woman with history of hypothyroid,
lupus, non-hodgkin's lymphoma s/p xrt and chemotherapy 17 years
ago who presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital earlier today
after a syncopal episode at home.

  A couple of weeks ago, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was in the bathroom
during the night. She awoke her husband and could not get off
the toilet. She felt faint. Her husband helped her up, noticing
that both of her legs and arms were cool. She lay back in her
recliner - in which she has slept since her radiotherapy and
lymphoma. Her husband asked if he should call EMS, but she
didn't think it necessary.

  Today, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4553**] was at home. Mr. [**Known lastname 4553**] went to work.
During the morning she felt faint and called EMS. They arrived
to find that she had fallen from her chair to the floor,
striking her head. Per [**Hospital3 1443**] ED, she was
unresponsive when the EMS arrived, unable to answer questions.
However, en route, she apparently complained of neck and back
pain. She was bradycardic to the 20s and transcutaneous pacing
was unsuccessful. Dopamine increased her heart rate and atropine
did little.

  On arrival the [**Hospital3 1443**] ED, she was described as
lethargic but communicative, but soon after became 'suddenly
ashen/cyanotic'. Dopamine gtt was started. Slow capillary refil
was noted. EKG was interpreted as 'complete heart block with AV
dissociation'. An echo was performed, per the Cardiology consult
note, which noted global hypokinesis and LVEF of 25-30% while
paced. Echos have previously been near normal.

  She was intubated for airway protection and sedation in the
setting of bradycardia and placement of the temp wire.
Tranvenous pacing wires were placed via a right subclavian line
under fluroscopy (the left actually has an adjacent 17-year-old
Port-A-Cath, still in place from treatment of her lymphoma).
Given likely necessity for a PPM/ICD and her hemodynamic
instability, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.

  She arrived in a rigid neck collar - although CT head and neck
had been performed at [**Hospital1 487**], [**Location (un) 1131**] was not completed. Her
vitals on arrival were 98.7 F, 85 BPM, 21 RR, 100%. Blood
pressure messurements varied widely, but were typically from 80s
to 100s systolic.

Past Medical History:
- Lupus, [**Doctor First Name **] supressed, manifests as pleural effusions, on
prednisone
- Hypothyroidism, s/p partial thyroidectomy w/ lymphoma of neck,
chemoradiation plus resection, on levothyroxine
- Hypertension
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Fibromyalgia, on oxycodone 7.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
- Sleep apnea, diagnosed, but has not wanted CPAP yet
- Depression, on fluoxetine
- Obesity
- Osteoporosis
- Cerebrovascular (small vessel) disease (on ASA and Plavix)

Social History:
-Tobacco history: None.
-ETOH: None.
-Illicit drugs: None.
Lives with husband in two family. Daughter and son-in-law live
upstairs with their son and a dog. Significant discord with
daughter and son-in-law at present. Also grandchildren upstairs.



Family History:
Family history of heart disease, but not of early onset.

Physical Exam:
General: morbidly obese woman
HEENT: Pupils symmetrically and markedly dilated (s/p atropine),
ears clear, tube in place, cannot inspect OP
Neck: Hematoma and echymosis on right lateral neck (later -
central line in place in right IJ), very thick neck, cannot
evaluate JVP.
Cardiac: Difficult to auscultate due to ventilator and habitus,
near tachycardic and regular.
Lungs: Symmetric air entry anteriorly with some transmitted
upper airway sound and ventilator noise.

History of Present Illness:
58 y/o female with no significant PMH who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**1-10**] with flu like symptoms. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was treated for a
presumed COPD flare but underwent respiratory decompensation at
that time eventually necessitating intubation for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. Her ABG in the ED was 7.29/47/145. Pt was
treated in the MICU with steroids and azithro. She was extubated
on [**1-13**] but after only 3.5 hours developed tachypnia and
tachycardia requiring reintubation. In further workup, pt's DFA
was negative for flu. A CTA showed severe emphysema and the pt
was continue on steroids and antibiotics. A sputum culture grew
strep pneumonia but the pt did not have an infiltrate on
imaging. On [**1-21**], the pt underwent controlled extubation in the
OR and has been stable from a respiratory standpoint since that
time. Pt failed her speech and swallow eval in the MICU and is

CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST ([**2171-1-10**]):
REPORT. A good quality CT pulmonary angiogram was obtained. The
CT pulmonary angiogram is negative for pulmonary embolism. There
is mild prominence of the aortic wall on contrast examination
possibly due to anemia. No other evidence of aortic pathology is
seen. There is some mild calcification of the descending
thoracic aorta. The patient is intubated and the tip of the ET
tube is in good position approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
A prominent pericardial recess is seen. A few small pretracheal
lymph nodes and hilar lymph nodes are seen. The largest lymph
node identified is in the right hilum and measures 12 mm in
short axis. Probable small goitre is seen.
There is profound centrilobular and panacinar emphysema present,
particularly in the upper zones, typical of cigarette smoking.
Some small paraseptal change is also identified, particularly
peripherally. Some minor bibasilar atelectasis is identified,
but there is no other pulmonary parenchymal abnormality seen.
The visualized portions of the bones appear normal.
CONCLUSION:
1. Profound emphysematous change.
2. Patient intubated.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
4. Probable mild goiter.

Radiology
[**1-18**] CXR: An area of consolidation has developed within the left
lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia. Given the focal
distribution, bacterial pneumonia is considered most likely. The
lungs are otherwise clear, and there is no definite
lymphadenopathy. Heart size remains normal.

[**1-22**] CXR: Interval improvement in left lower lobe consolidation.
Suggestion of a thin-walled bulla in the left lower lobe.
Attention to this area on followup examination is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
42 year old male with HIV presents with productive cough, fever,
and hypotension, admitted to ICU for septic shock secondary to
bacterial pneumonia

1) Septic shock/bacterial pneumonia: The patient was admitted to
the ICU, where he was fluid resuscitated, covered with broad
antibiotics (Zosyn/levofloxacin), and treated with pressors to
maintain a MAP >65. He responded well and was transferred to the
general medical floor on Zosyn/azithromycin. Given continued
fevers and history of MRSA (although sputum culture with only
oropharyngeal flora), vancomycin was added to his regimen with
rapid improvement in symptoms. He completed a 5 day course of
azithromycin and was discharged on cefpodoxime and vancomycin
(PICC line placed [**1-24**]). Blood cultures had no growth to date at
the time of discharge and urinalysis was negative.

2) HIV: Most recent office visit note [**5-/2171**] noted CD4 count of
645 and undetectable VL. He was continued on Lopinavir-Ritonavir
and Combivir.

3) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped to a nadir of 28 on
[**1-19**] from 38. Iron studies were not consistent with iron
deficiency and vitamin B12/folate were normal. The hematocrit
drop was most likely due to sepsis-related marrow suppression
and hemodilution in the setting of volume resuscitation. The
patient's hematocrit gradually rose and was 36 on discharge.

4) Depression: The patient was continued on fluoxetine.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old male who
was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2139-7-5**], for shortness of breath and with a room air oxygen
saturation of 72%.  He had been admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] from
[**3-16**] to [**3-26**] with hypoxia and bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates.  Work-up at that time involved
bronchoscopy which was negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 14174**] of tissue
eventually grew out alpha Streptococcus.  He improved
clinically with diuresis, and an echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 40%, anterior septal akinesis, apical
akinesis, anterior hypokinesis, and akinesis.

Clinically, although he improved with diuresis during that
admission, he was treated with Levaquin.  Since that
discharge, he has been started on Lasix and Lopressor with
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20612**] on [**4-15**] and [**5-3**]; however, he
continued to have increasing lower leg edema.

On this admission in the Emergency Department, he arrived
with an oxygen saturation of 72%, 92-96% on non-rebreather.
An ABG done at that time showed a pH of 7.39, 30, 94 on
non-rebreather.  He had transient orthostatic hypotension
because he missed his morning dose of Midodrine.  At the time
of admission in the Emergency Department, he was noted to be
febrile to 101.5??????, otherwise with normal vitals signs.  In
the Emergency Department, he was treated with Levaquin,
Prednisone, and intravenous Bactrim.  He was then transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was diuresed with
intravenous Lasix, and urine output to that was over a liter.
He became stable at 95% on 4 L with room air oxygen
saturations of 88-92%, and the patient himself said that he
felt much less short of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end-stage renal
disease status post a living-related donor kidney transplant
in [**2131-1-9**], diabetes mellitus with significant
neuropathy with orthostatic hypotension, nephropathy
requiring renal transplant, retinopathy with a history of
retinal hemorrhages.  The patient has a nephrostomy tube.  He
has obstructive sleep apnea and has been on BIPAP since
[**Month (only) 1096**].  His left ankle is significant for Charcot joint,
and he has a history of recurrent cellulitis.  His ejection
fraction in [**2139-3-12**] was as stated prior.  He has had
multiple skin cancers.  Coronary artery disease by stress
test.

[**2175-8-1**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation varies
depending on loading conditions. With a systolic blood pressure
> 160 mmHg, moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. When the
systolic blood pressure is 100-160 mmHg, the mitral
regurgitation decreases to mild-to-moderate (1+). There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results at the time of the study.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is A-paced and is on a phenylephrine infusion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function continues to be
normal without regional wall motion abnormalities. Mitral
regurgitation continues to vary from mild to moderate depending
on loading conditions. Mild aortic regurgitation persists. The
thoracic aorta is normal.

excluded.

CXR [**2181-3-4**]: Portable chest radiograph demonstrates a large-bore
catheter on the right extending into the cavoatrial junction.
The left IJ catheter has been removed. The left costophrenic
angle has been omitted from the study. There is a probable small
left pleural effusion. There is patchy atelectasis at the left
lung base. There is also mild patchy airspace opacity in both
lungs which could represent a combination of atelectasis or
aspiration, possibly infiltrate. There is mild congestive
failure. Heart is top normal in size.

LUE U/S [**2181-3-6**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left
arm.

CXR [**2181-3-9**]: Since [**2181-3-6**], lung volumes are lower,
increasing bibasilar dependant atelectasis. Note that the right
costophrenic angle was excluded. Small left pleural effusion is
likely unchanged. Mild volume overload persists. A right PICC, a
right central venous line, and a gastrostomy tube are still in
place. There is no other change.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. Myocardial infarction.
2. Unstable angina.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 3
([**2141-2-28**]).
3. Take back, reexploration for left internal mammary artery
kink/torsion ([**2141-3-2**]).
4. Persistent atrial fibrillation.
5. Acute renal failure, resolved.
6. Right-sided cerebrovascular accident with left arm
weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
woman whose problems began with chronic back pain usually
controlled with Tylenol.  She noted an exacerbation on
[**2141-2-12**] and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **]
[**First Name (Titles) 620**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for low back pain.  During her work-up there
she received an x-ray which confirmed a compression fracture
at the L3 level.  She was managed conservatively with
physical therapy.  The patient did, however, develop chest
pain and shortness of breath on [**2141-2-15**].  Ultimately, the
patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK
of 120 and a peak troponin of 5.0.  The patient was treated
per their protocol with Lovenox and Plavix, given her allergy
to aspirin.  She was continued on her other cardiac
medications including nitrates, beta blockade and ACE
inhibitor.  The patient was diuresed and symptomatically
improved within 12 hours.  There was discussion about cardiac
catheterization but given resolution of symptoms, the patient
deferred the option of cardiac catheterization.  The patient
was transferred back to her [**Hospital3 **] facility and was
otherwise asymptomatic until [**2141-2-24**] when the patient
developed persistent severe chest pain in the morning.  The
patient also had palpitations.  She was brought in at that
time for probable cardiac catheterization and evaluation of
her chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Congestive heart failure.  2.
Osteoporosis, lumbar fracture.  3. Celiac sprue.  4. Atrial
fibrillation.  5. History of urinary retention.  6. History
of syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.  7. History of
pneumonia.  8. Myocardial infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission in general the patient
was an elderly woman in no acute distress.  Vital signs:
Temperature 97.8, heart rate 82, blood pressure 140/80,
respiratory rate 18, saturating 98% on two liters nasal
cannula.  HEENT were normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular
movements intact, pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light, anicteric, normal sclerae.  Neck was supple, midline
without masses or lymphadenopathy.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was irregularly
irregular.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without
masses or organomegaly.  Extremities were warm, noncyanotic,
nonedematous x 4.  Neurologic examination was alert and
oriented with no gross defect.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count was 6.7/30.2/322.
Chemistries were 124/4.6/92/25/11/0.3/100.  INR was 1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for work-up of her
chest pain and history of non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction.  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization
on [**2141-2-24**] which revealed the ejection fraction of 45%, a
right dominant coronary artery system with severe
three-vessel disease.  Also noted was mild mitral
regurgitation as well.  The patient at that time had
evaluation by the cardiothoracic surgery team.  It was
decided to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting.  On
[**2141-2-27**] the patient was taken to the operating room for
coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery, left radial to the obtuse marginal and right radial
to the RPL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She
was subsequently extubated on postoperative day one.  The
patient was maintained on multiple drips including insulin,
Milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin and propofol.  The
patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation in the CSRU.
She did have a low urine output for which the renal service
was consulted.  They came up with an assessment of oliguria
with hyponatremia and acute renal failure.  This may be due
to the dye load.  In addition, the patient's low cardiac
output and congestive heart failure picture prompted
recatheterization.  Upon recatheterization, the left internal

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
male with a past medical history of CAD, NQWMI, status post
two vessel CABG plus AVR ([**2148**]) and DC cardioversion,
[**2161-5-14**], who presented to the ER with a two-day history of
dyspnea and PND.  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation and underwent DC cardioversion on [**2161-5-14**].  The
patient was hypotensive following the cardioversion and
required per report up to 7 liters of saline, accompanied by
a weight change of approximately 9 pounds (from 186 pounds to
195 pounds).  The patient states that he was feeling well
prior to the DC cardioversion and that subsequently had
dyspnea on exertion as well as shortness of breath at rest.
The patient stated that he had approximately 3-4 episodes of
PND over the 2 nights prior to admission.  He also had 1
brief episode of substernal chest pain that lasted 2-3
minutes the day prior to admission at 2:00 p.m. that began
when he went from a sitting to a standing position and
resolved spontaneously.

He describes the chest discomfort as central, substernal,
sharp, non-radiating, non-pleuritic and this is not
associated with diaphoresis, palpitations, nausea or
vomiting.  He does deny lower extremity edema and denies
having any significant history of angina since his CABG in
[**2148**].  On further review of systems, the patient admits to
having upper respiratory tract infection symptoms over the
past 3-4 days including cough productive of clear white
sputum.  There were no fever, chills, diarrhea, headache,
rash or arthralgia.  The patient, of note, has a significant
EtOH history and drinks up to 8 beers per day.  His last
drink was at 6:00 p.m. on the day prior to admission.

In the emergency department the patient received 40 mg of
Lasix, supplemental oxygen, 325 mg of aspirin and was started
on nitroglycerin drip.  His ECG showed sinus bradycardia with
PR prolongation, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and
atrioventricular conduction delay and diffused ST and T-wave
changes, (there was no significant change in comparison with
the prior ECG of [**2161-5-14**]).  The patient's chest film was
consistent with mild CHF.  An echocardiogram revealed mild
symmetric LVH with an EF of 50 to 55 percent and mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis with 1 plus AR and 1 plus MR.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2148**] at the [**Location (un) 511**] [**Hospital **] Hospital.  He had

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old male with a history of type 1
diabetes complicated by chronic kidney disease, multiple
episodes of hypoglycemia attributed to insulin receptor
autoantibody syndrome now on immunosuppression who is admitted
to the MICU for altered mental status. On the morning of
admission, patient was found in his bed unresponsive by his
family. EMS was called and upon arrival FSBG was 20.  He
received 1 amp of D50 and according to EMS reports, he was
briefly responsive but again became upresponsive and was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Of note, he has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for
altered mental status which has required intubation in the past.
Many times this is due to hypoglycemia and mental status
typically improves with correction of his hypoglycemia. He was
most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 20873**] to the general medical
service for hypoglycemia and mental status improved rapidly.
Prior to this admission he was admitted at the end of [**8-/2126**]
where he was followed by endocrinology and rheumatology and he
was initiated on azathioprine for his insulin receptor
autoantibody syndrome and received a course of prednisone. On
his most recent admission he was continued on his azathioprine
and prednisone without change.
.
In the ED, T<96 rectal, 193/91, 78, 14, 100% NRB. Exam showed
PERRL, clenched jaw so gag could not be performed, and he was
not withdrawing to painful stimuli. FSBG in ED was normal at
139.  Subsequent checks remained normal at 96 and 104.  Despite
normal FSBGs he remained unresponsive.  He received a dose of
narcan without improvement. He had abnormal movements in the ED,
seizures vs shivering and he received 2 mg of ativan without
significant change. On a recent trip to the ED, he required
intubation by anesthesia for a difficult airway and anesthesia
was called today. However, once anesthesia arrived, patient sat
up in bed and was conversant, A+Ox3. ROS was negative at that
time. He remained somnolent in the ED but was easily arousable
so he was not intubated as it was felt he was protecting his
airway. ABG 7.38/49/248 on 3LNC. Labs remarkable for Hct of
23(within recent baseline), electrolytes normal with the
exception of BUN/Cr of 117/6.5 (baseline Cr 5.5-6), lipase of
204, CK 367 with normal MBI (MB 11). Serum tox screen was
negative. ECG, CXR, and CT head were unremarkable. He was
initially started on D5NS @ 100 cc/hr which was changed to D5W
prior to transfer given h/o chronic kidney disease.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is obtunded. Unresponsive to pain
and sternal rub.  Cannot be aroused. ROS cannot be obtained.

IMAGING:

Chest x-ray: New moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is 56 year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
20%) and Type 1 diabetes who presented with hypotension,
pulmonary edema, and fever to 102.6.
.
1. Hypotension/Fever: Etiology of his presentation was unclear.
His hypotension responded to fluid ressucitation and pressors.
He was intially treated with stress dose steroids, which were
stopped once he had a normal cortisol stimulation test.
Infectious work-up was negative with the exception of a possible
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  Urinary legionella was negative.  He
was treated with levofloxacin for presumed community acquired
pneumonia.  He was discharged to complete a 14 day course of
levofloxacin.
.
2. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: He had no evidence of acute
ischemia.  He had 3 sets of cardiac enzymes that were negative.
He was maintained on his outpatient aspirin, plavix, statin, and
digoxin.  His metoprolol was initially held given hypotension,
but was restarted prior to discahrge.  Once he was no longer
hypotensive, he was restarted on his outpatient diuretics to
decrease his pulmonary edema.  He diuresed well.
.
3. Chronic kidney disease: He is status post renal transplant.
His creatinine was initially slightly above his baseline and
that improved with fluid ressucitation.  he was maintained on
cyclosporin (level therapeutic), azathioprine, and prednisone
for immunosuppression.
.
4. Diabetes: While in the intensive care unit, he required an
insulin drip for good glycemic control.  Once on the floor, he
was restarted on his outpatient glargine at 26 units at night.
At the time, he was not eating regularly and he had problems
with hypoglycemia.  His glargine was decreased to 6 units with
improvement in hypoglycemia.  His glargine will need to be
increased back to 26 once he is eating regularly.
.
5. Anemia: He has anemia secondary to renal disease.  He
receives epoeitin as an outpatient and did not received any
while an inpatient.  He did receive 1 unit of red cells during
this admission.
.
6. FEN: Cardiac, low salt, diabetic diet.  He had speech and
swallow evaluation that recommended a soft diet.
.
7. Code: full code

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old female with
a history of type 2 diabetes, bipolar disorder, multiple
psychiatric admissions, asthma, hypertension, who was found down
at her nursing home at 8 p.m. on the day prior to admission.

Per the nursing home staff she had a fingerstick of 289 earlier
that evening, and the patient was given permission to administer
herself one unit of Humalog insulin.  Per the patient, the [**Doctor Last Name **]
House staff watched her draw the one unit and administer this.
She has only given herself insulin injections twice before.

She remembers falling asleep, but per the staff she was noted
to have three to four generalized tonic-clonic seizures and
reportedly had a fingerstick of 10.  She was given thiamine,
glucose, 8 mg of Ativan with decreased seizure activity, per
reports.  She was subsequently intubated for airway
protection with declining mental status and concern that the
patient had aspirated, large food particles were then
suctioned from her airway.  Patient was treated with
Clindamycin for two days in the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
has remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and was
extubated the day prior to being transferred to the floor.

The Neurology service consulted on her in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and recommended checking an MRI and an
EEG to rule out any structural seizure focus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.5, heart rate 59 to
85, blood pressure 80 to 124/32 to 82, respirations 18,
oxygen saturation 94 to 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula,
fingerstick about 300.  Generally, she is in no acute
distress, alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes are moist with no jugular venous distention, no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm;
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended; normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are
without edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurological:  Cranial nerves II-XII are intact, moving all
extremities well.  Sensation grossly intact with bilateral
deep tendon reflexes [**12-27**].

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 26.4,

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 24 year old woman with a history of prior suicide
attempts who presented to the ED with a suicide attempt. Patient
reports that at 9 pm she bought 3 bottles of 325 mg aspirin. She
took 200-250 tablets. The group home staff where she lives were
suspicous and called 911. When she arrived at the ED she was
alert and oriented and complained of nausea. Aspirin level was
39. ABG 7.42/32/151 and serum bicarbonate was 19. She was given
50 meq of sodium bicarbonate, charcol and dolasetron and started
on a bicarbonate drip. A repeat ASA level was 100 and chem 7 had
a bicarbonate of 16 with an AG of 28.
Patient was admitted to the MICU and dialyzed for such high ASA
levels until level lowered to 16. HD catheter removed from R
groin on [**6-20**]. Removal complicated by large hematoma and
hematocrit drop from 37 to 26. Baseline Hct appears to be closer
to 33. CT abdomen negative for retroperitoneal bleed. Patient
was then transferred out of the unit.

# ASA overdose: Pt reports taking 250 325mg tablets = 80grams.
Became obtunded upon arrival to MICU, which improved with
subsequent agitation. Need for dialysis given very high levels
(>100). HD line placed and pt dialyzed x1. Pt required
intubation for airway protection and was hyperventilated to
avoid acidemia in setting of asa overdose. Maintained on sodium
bicarb until ASA level nondetectable on [**2152-9-25**], at which point
sodium bicarb fluids d/c'ed.  Patient self-extubated. Acid-base
disorder stabilized.

# Anemia: Pt had a HCT trend down to 23 in the ICU, with BRBPR
and hard stools.  GI conult felt due to ASA gastritis vs
hemorroidal bleed mostly. She gives a history consistent with
GERD. Was tranfused 1U x PRBC, HCT to 28 --> 30.  She is on PPI

atrophy, old lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the basal ganglia,
small vessel disease, some asymmetry of the periventricular
white matter to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right frontal lobe. She
was started on a course of prophylactic antibiotics for recent
testing which came back negative for C-diff which she has
completed. She was admitted for hydration and developed chest
pain shortly after her admission. She was found to be in atrial
fibrillation and was admitted to the ICU, was started on
amiodarone and converted to SR. She continued to have chest
discomfort and subsequently underwent a stress test that
revealed an inferior defect with inferior infarct. Troponins
were drawn
(beginning [**2172-5-23**] 3.07, 3.47, 2.68, 3.53, 4.07) and patient
ruled in for NSTEMI. An echo done on [**2172-5-23**] showed an EF of
50-55%. After her chest pain was brought under control and she
was subsequently transferred to the telemetry floor and has done
well for the past week. She presently denies chest pain. She was
transferred for further evaluation and for a cardiac
catheterization. She was found to have three vessel disease. She
is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative
preservation of apical segments (suggestive of a non-ischemic
myopathy). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

CATH: [**2104-2-4**]

1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
no
angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
 The
left main coronary artery, LAD, LCX, and RCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics were performed.  Right sided pressures
were
severely elevated (mean RA pressure was 33 mm Hg and RVEDP was
32 mm
Hg).  Pulmonary artery pressures were severely elevated (PA
pressure was
70/28 mm Hg).  Left sided pressures were severely elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 34 mm Hg and LVEDP was 36 mm Hg).  Central arterial

pressure was mildly elevated (aortic pressure was 144/95 mm Hg).

Cardiac index was low (at 1.6 L/min/m2).  There was no
significant
gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter
from the
left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed secondary to
markedly

ejection
fraction.

Patient's history with EP started [**5-1**] when she had a [**Month/Year (2) 4448**]
placed for AF/tachy-brady. She was also started on coumadin and
sotalol, however the sotalol was stopped [**3-1**] symptoms of
worsening right heart failure. TTE showed dilated left and right
atria with normal LVEF. In addition, she was noted to have a new
small pericardial effusion of unclear etiology which was
followed by serial imaging and eventually resolved in the Fall
[**2163**]. She states that she was doing well until [**4-2**] when she was
admitted for AF with RVR and CHF exacerbation. She was
rate-controlled, diuresed, and started on dofetilide and
converted to sinus prior to discharge. On follow-up TTE, a small
RA lead mass was noted that was thought to be a thrombus and INR
goal was increased to 3.5. [**9-2**] TTE revealed the stable RA mass
but return of a small pericardial effusion.

She resented to clinic on [**11-30**] for follow-up and reported
worsening abdominal bloating and DOE. She was able to walk to
work prior to [**11-20**] but since this time becomes SOB with minimal
exertion. Notes increased ankle edema but no PND or orthopnea.
Does occasionally have palpitations. Denies chest pain. Found to
have 16mm Hg pulsus paradoxus and worsened pericardial effusion
on TTE but no obvious hemodynamic compromise. Admitted from
clinic for rate-control, diuresis, and further w/u of
pericardial effusion.

On ROS, denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
Reports anorexia and recent weight loss of unclear amount. No
diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia.

(no evidence of tamponade). 2. After volume loading with 1000 cc
of normal saline, the RA pressure rose to 15 mmHg and the PCWP
rose to 23 mmHg.  Again, there was no equalization of pressures
or evidence of tamponade, but cardiac index remained low.
3. After placing a magnet over the patient's [**Year (4 digits) 4448**] which
increased the heart rate to 80 bpm, the hemodynamics were
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.  [**Known lastname 13260**] is a 75 year old male with severe COPD, prostate ca
s/p lupron and brachytherapy, PAF, urinary retention who
presents with respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD
exacerbation.

# COPD - AE, Patient is known to have severe COPD. His blood
gasses showed significant hypercarbia and he was initially
wheezing on exam, making COPD exacerbation the most likely
diagnosis.  Patient had significant improvement with nebs,
steroids, antibiotics, lasix.  Got ceftaz/levaquin to cover
severe CAP, however ceftaz stopped given lack of cough, fever,
wbc or clinical suggestion of pneumonia.   He initially diuresed
1L with lasix, but appeared euvolemic so did not have
significant further lasix. Patient will be discharged on slow
Prednisone 40mg PO taper and placed on Spiriva/Combivent/Duoneb.
Patient was observed in the MICU on non-rebreather until
determined to be stable for the floor. Patient completed a seven
day course of Levoquin. Cultures were negative through the
course of the admission. At the time of discharge patient was
sating 94% on baseline oxygen of 2L and 87% 2L on ambulation.

using accessory muscles. Received combivent neb, solumedrol 125
mg, and azithro 500 mg po x1. CXR and CTA chest were
unremarkable except for chronic changes. Was doing well on 3L,
but felt more tired so he was transitioned to bipap. EKG with
RAD, RBBB (new since [**2192**]. Patient was growing more
uncomfortable on bipap, so he took it off for about 30 minutes,
but still sounded tight, so he was placed back on bipap 10/5
with FiO2 50%. Patient had increased WOB, and did not tolerate
Bipap so was intubated and started on propafol prior to
transfer.  On propafol, patient dropped his BP to 84/65 so he
was changed to versed, and he was detached from the vent in case
of contribution of auto-peep. 1 L of NS was hung, and BP
improved to SBP 100s.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematuria, dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
male with a history of renal cell carcinoma status post
cadaveric renal transplant in [**2101-8-5**] with native
nephrectomy in [**2093**], hypertension with recent admission for
hypoglycemia and severe hypertension. The patient was found
to have REF status post renal stent to the transplant renal
artery on [**2104-1-30**]. There was 90% stenosis noted. At
that time, he was also hypoxic, and work-up was negative.

An angiogram was done. He was found to have a 14 mm x 8 mm
soft tissue mass in the area of the left nephrectomy site. He
complained of dyspnea on exertion and some chest pain, as
well as some weakness in his legs when walking. He complained
of hematuria since his previous admission with bilateral
groin pain. He also complained of positive chest pain and
light-headedness but denied dyspnea, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  DM Type 2, hypertension, end-stage
renal disease, left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in
[**2093**], renal artery stenosis in the transplant kidney status
post PTCA in [**2104-1-6**], obstructive sleep apnea, Barrett's
esophagus, hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left nephrectomy in [**2093**], AV graft on
the left upper extremity, right lower extremity AV fistula,
nasal polyps, asthma.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  CellCept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Rapamune 4 mg p.o. daily, prednisone 5 mg p.o. daily, Bactrim
single strength 1 tablet p.o. q.Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
NPH Insulin 10 units q.a.m., clonidine 0.3 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily, labetalol 400 mg p.o. t.i.d., aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married. He works in the
nutrition department at [**Hospital6 256**].
He denies alcohol, drugs and smoking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with renal disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 98.2, heart
rate 82, blood pressure 132/50, respiratory rate 18, 94% on
room air. General: He was alert and oriented in mild
distress. Lungs: Rhonchi diffusely throughout.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. There was a 3 out of
6 systolic ejection murmur. Abdomen: Soft, tender inferior to
the allograft, negative bruit.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit on admission was 20, previous
hematocrit had been 28 on [**1-27**]; sodium 135, potassium
4.3, chloride 100, CO2 28, BUN 22, creatinine 2.0.

On admission CT without contrast was done to evaluate the
falling hematocrit and right groin pain with elevated
creatinine, as well as hematuria. Findings demonstrated no
retroperitoneal hematoma, there was interval washout of
increased attenuation seen within the transplanted kidney
cortex consistent with washout of contrast. Stool was noted
throughout the colon consistent with constipation.

Chest x-ray demonstrated no evidence of pneumonia.

A renal transplant ultrasound demonstrated normal transplant
flow with normal arterial wave forms in the upper mid and
lower poles. Resistive indices were 0.8, 0.71 and 0.9
respectively. Venous flow and wave forms were normal as well.

Urine cytology was sent off. This demonstrated no malignant
cells, acellular debris, histiocytes, red blood cells and
bacteria. Urinalysis demonstrated RBCs [**6-14**], white blood
cells 0-2, rare growth of bacteria, no yeast, 0-2 epithelial
cells, negative nitrite, protein 100. Urine culture on
[**2104-2-3**], was negative. Repeat urine culture on
[**2104-2-4**], was contaminated. A repeat urine culture on
[**2-7**] demonstrated 10-100,000 colonies of gram-positive
bacteria, alpha-hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha
streptococcus or lactobacillus. Second isolate demonstrated
less than 10,000 organisms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Nephrology was consulted and followed
closely throughout this hospital course making
recommendations that were in agreement with the transplant
plan. Prednisone 5 mg was continued, as well as CellCept [**Pager number **]
mg p.o. b.i.d. and Rapamune 4 mg p.o. daily. Recommendations
included holding aspirin and Plavix; this was done.

A vascular consult was obtained for hematuria and hematocrit
of 20. An MRI was recommended to evaluate for retroperitoneal
bleed.  An MRI with and without contrast was obtained. This
demonstrated normal renal transplant located in the right
lower quadrant, patent transplant renal artery and vein, no
hydronephrosis or peritransplant collection. No cause for
hematuria was demonstrated. It was recommended to continue
the aspirin and Plavix.

He received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 20. There was concern for hemolysis with
hemoglobinuria. An LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count,
parvovirus, IgG, IgAM, PCR and smear for cytoryctes were
obtained. Reticulocyte count was 3.6, fibrinogen 626, PT
11.5, PTT 20, INR 1, platelet count 3","25000, 4019, 2851","Diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, type II or unspecified type, not stated as uncontrolled; Unspecified essential hypertension; Acute posthemorrhagic anemia",3,,,,,

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 54 F with h/o non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, diastolic CHF
with EF >55%, MR, severe pulm HTN thought [**2-21**] UIP/IPF on
steroids, DM2, HTN, PAF on coumadin, s/p renal Xplant in [**2143**] on
IS, who presents from [**Hospital 21970**] Hospital after asystolic arrest.
Per report, the patient presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on
[**2149-8-2**] after feeling sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain,
and SOB. In the ED, she was treated for her CP but was found to
be in pulm edema and rapid afib. She was admitted to the ICU for
further care, where they aggressively rate controlled her and
diuresed her with lasix. Given her rapid afib, the patient was
started on sotalol on [**8-4**], where she converted to sinus rythm
on [**8-5**]. The patient remained stable until the afternoon of
transfer.

Per report, the patient subsequently went into asystolic arrest
at about 2:30PM on [**8-10**] requiring defibrillation, epi 1mg x4,
atropine 1mg x1, vasopressin 40units x1, lidocaine 100mg x1,
Amiodarone 150mg x1, bicarb, Ca returning her to sinus rythm.
There were no reported shocks. She was intubated during this
event and started on dopamine/neo for sbps in the 80s. In the
ICU, a PA line was placed demonstrating CVP 16, PAP 85/35 and
PCWP 40 with CO 1.4. A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp
pacing wire for bradycardia. The patient was then switched to
nitro/levophed and given lasix 100mg IV x1. Bedside echo showed
EF 40%. ABG at the time of transfer was 7.35/31/60 on 100% Fi02
and PEEP 5. Due to family request, the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated with
possible responsiveness. She arrived on nitro/levophed drip. She
was unable to provide history.

Also of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2149-6-12**] for increased abd girth and SOB thought [**2-21**] CHF
exacerbation. She was diuresed at that time with
lasix/metolazone. The patient also underwent R heart cath
confirming pulm hypertension(RVEDP = 20 mm Hg, mean PCWP 11 mm
Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg). She underwent lung
biospy and evaluation by pulmonology showing likely UIP/IPF and
was started on high dose prednisone. She was also maintained on
cytoxan for her renal transplant.

ROS: Unable to obtain review of systems due to patient being
intubated/sedated.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old woman with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction at age 35 and six vessel coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2108**] who presented with new onset of chest pressure
associated with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitation
and nausea starting at around 10 AM on the day of admission.
The pain started at breakfast and it radiated to her throat
and left arm.  It was 7 out of 10 in onset and progressed to
10 out of 10 about one hour later.  She took one sublingual
nitroglycerin without significant improvement.  She called
her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] who told her to call 911.  She
was brought in by Emergency Medical Services and she felt
better after being given oxygen and two baby Aspirin (the
patient had taken her baby Aspirin 81 mg in the morning
before the episode).  Of note, the patient also fell during
the episode secondary to her left leg weakness.  In the
Emergency Room she was found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation with heartrate of 170, blood pressure 148/78,
oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters.  She was given one dose of
25 mg intravenous Diltiazem and her rhythm went back into
sinus.  She was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction at age 35, status post six vessel
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2108**].  Aortic stenosis.
Echocardiogram in [**2115-7-6**] showed moderately severe aortic
stenosis with significant progression since [**2114-8-5**],
aortic valve increased from 3 to 4.1 and gradient from 36 to
69.  The aortic valve area estimated to be .7 cm.  Recent
admission to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital three weeks ago or syncopal
episode, etiology thought to be vasovagal in the setting of
moderately severe aortic stenosis.  Rheumatoid arthritis in
the past three years on chronic Prednisone and Methotrexate.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, status post right carotid endarterectomy
in [**2112**].  Status post episode of pneumonia.  Status post from
outside hospital, exercise stress test in [**2113-7-6**].
Heartrate maximum at 123, stopped secondary to shortness of
breath, no chest pain or anginal symptoms.  No significant
electrocardiogram changes.  Perfusion scan is normal.  Normal
wall motion, normal ejection fraction.  Echocardiogram in
[**2115-7-6**] showed left atrial dilatation.  Concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy, aortic valve peak gradient 69.6,
mean of 31.9, aortic valve area estimated to be .7 cm, 2 to
3+ mitral regurgitation.  PA pressure increased to 45 mm
mercury.  Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated to be
60%.  No wall motion abnormality.  Left ventricular size and
function were normal.  Right ventricular size and function
were normal.

ALLERGIES:  Motrin and Aspirin causing bleeding.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Baby Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.;

no children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at age 67, father died at age
72, brother died at age 62 all secondary to heart disease,
sister at age 71 with heart problems.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Syncopal episode three weeks ago,
admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital, etiology thought to be
vasovagal in the setting of moderate severe aortic stenosis.
Has been feeling tired in the past one to two weeks.  Three
pillow orthopnea in the past year.  Increased from two pillow
orthopnea, had been feeling increasingly weak in the past
year, with decreased activity. Positive for claudication and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed the patient to be afebrile, temperature 97.3, blood
pressure 116/72, heartrate 76, respirations 22, oxygen
saturation 96% on room air.  In general, pleasant elderly

ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CONGESTIVE HEART
FAILURE/VALVULAR DISEASE:  Patient status post aortic valve
repair and aortic root repair.  Patient oxygenating well at
time of discharge with no evidence of overt CHF.  Patient
actually hypovolemic to euvolemic by exam, and has been
getting gentle hydration x two days with improved urine
output.  Diuretics are being held, and patient is continued
on his ACE inhibitor at the time of discharge.

2) CHRONIC VENT DEPENDENCE:  Patient with chronic illness,
myopathy and neuropathy with malnutrition and severe weakness
contributing to chronic vent dependence.  Patient stable on
current vent settings which include pressure support
ventilation during the day with pressure support of 18, PEEP
5, FIO2 40%.  Patient has been comfortable, resting on assist
control during the evening with tidal volume of 400 by
respiratory rate of 10 with PEEP of 5 and FIO2 of 40%.
Patient should be continued on these settings including AC in
the evening until he has significant improvement in his
nutritional status and improvement in his level of strength.
Aggressive attempts to wean him by switching him to pressure
support in the evening should not be attempted, at least in
the short-term.

3) PSEUDOMONAL PNEUMONIA/CHRONIC SPUTUM COLONIZATION:
Patient with a history of pseudomonal pneumonia and
pseudomonal UTI earlier in this admission.  Patient with
persistent sputum cultures positive for Pseudomonas and has
been placed on pseudomonal precautions.  However, he shows no
evidence of an acute infection, has been afebrile with stable
oxygenation and minimal sputum production.  Chest x-ray is
notable for a persistent left lower lobe density which we
have interpreted as a chronic resolving infiltrate versus
atelectasis.

4) HYPERCALCEMIA:  During the last two to three weeks of the
patient's prolonged hospitalization, the patient developed
refractory, severe hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
Work-up of his hypercalcemia revealed a low-normal PTH level
with low Vitamin D levels.  PTH-RP was also negative.  The
etiology of his hypercalcemia was thought more likely to
represent chronic immobility with bone leeching of calcium
versus a primary bony process such as Paget's disease.  On
bone scan, patient was noted to have increased uptake in the
area of a soft tissue/bony mass adjacent to the left
glenohumeral joint, but not invading the joint space itself.
This lesion had been noted on a prior MRI in [**Month (only) 956**], but
has increased in size since that time.  Bone scan also
revealed symmetric uptake in the knees and ankles bilaterally
which was not thought to be significant.

On [**2159-3-27**], patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left
bony mass with pathology pending at the time of discharge.
For treatment of the patient's hypercalcemia, he initially
was treated with aggressive IV fluids and diuretics.  He
received a dose of calcitonin.  He ultimately responded to a
dose of 30 mg IV of pamidronate wit a calcium level that
began to trend down.  However, on [**2159-3-25**], the calcium level
stabilized and began to trend back upward in excess of 12.5.
On [**2159-3-25**], the patient was redosed with pamidronate 50 mg
IV x one.  Vitamin D levels were aggressively repleted
parenterally, and the patient was discharged on a stable dose
of calcitriol Vitamin D.   A repeat Vitamin D level is
pending at the time of discharge, and I will follow-up on
this and communicate results to rehab.  Osteocalcin level as
a part of a work-up for Paget's disease is also pending at
the time of discharge.  Bone biopsy results will also be
passed on to rehab.  The patient will be required to have
daily calcium level checks to verify that he is neither
hypercalcemic requiring further dosing of pamidronate versus
hypocalcemic secondary to pamidronate.

5) PANCREATITIS:  Patient with pancreatitis of unclear
etiology earlier in his hospitalization.  His amylase and
lipase have trended down, and he has been tolerating tube
feeds with a benign abdominal exam indicating that it is not
currently an active issue.

6) HYPERNATREMIA:  Patient has been continued on free water
boluses to supplement his tube feeding to maintain a sodium
level of approximately 140.  Sodium level should be checked
at least several times per week for the next several weeks.

7) VOLUME STATUS:  As noted, the patient appears to be
clinically hypovolemic to euvolemic with no evidence of overt
volume overload or congestive heart failure.  Urine output
was approximately 40 cc/h at the time of discharge.

8) ANEMIA:  Patient has had a stable hematocrit of
approximately 28-30 for the majority of his hospitalization.
Iron level was normal, but TIBC was low, and ferritin level
was very elevated consistent with an anemia of chronic
disease.  His iron stores appear to be good.  He was started
on Epogen [**Hospital1 **]","4280, 5990","Congestive heart failure, unspecified; Urinary tract infection, site not specified",2,,,,,

Bone marrow biopsy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21540**] is a 57 year old with a PMH significant for HIV
with a recent admission at [**Hospital1 34**] for pancytopenia.  Per nightfloat
admission History and Physical, the patient states that he
initially started experiencing symptoms of dry cough and fatigue
at the end of [**Month (only) **]. Prior to this he has felt otherwise well in
good health.  The patient has been HIV positive since [**2099**],
stable until 3 weeks ago when presented to S. [**Hospital **] hospital
with fevers and pancytopenia.  He also endorses low grade fever
at that time. He denies having [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], sinus congestion, CP,
n/v/d, abd pain, rash, or lower ext swelling. He thus presented
to S [**Hospital **] Hosp on [**2110-7-31**]. There he was found to be pancytopenic
with WBC 1.9, Hct 16.5, Plt 11. His bili, AST/ALT were also
mildly elevated. He was therefore admitted there for 2+ weeks
for further work up. He presumably underwent bronch which was
neg for PCP (per patient). CT chest/abd was only notable for
fatty infiltration of the liver, spenomegaly, and mild
atelectasis. Other infectious work up was neg. He received
multiple transfusions, and underwent a bone marrow biopsy before
being discharged home. His bone marrow bipsy was thought to be
myelodysplasia. Upon follow up on [**8-20**], he was found to be
persistently pancytopenic. After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was thus transferred for further work up. Of note,
he denies travel though he lives on [**Location (un) **]. He denies sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has lost 10lbs since this began.  While there, he
received multiple transfusions, bone marrow bx preliminary dx
was myelodysplasia and he was discharged to home approximately a
week ago.

Repeat labs performed the day prior to admission at [**Hospital1 34**]
demonstrated WBC 1000 (WBC 1000 - 23 poly, 65 lymph, 12 mono, 1
nuc.rbc), hgb 7.9, hct 22.8, platelets 21. He was readmitted and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of pancytopenia.  Of
note, bone marrow biopsy slides were sent to [**Hospital1 112**] for further
read.

In the ED, T 98.1, HR 100, BP 107/70, RR 18, 96%RA. Labs
confirmed pancytopenia/neutropenia. Pt subsequently spiked to
101.3. Pt was given Cefepime 2g IV x1, vanco added upon initial
transfer to the floors.

Currently, he states that he is fatigued but otherwise resting
comfortably without complaints.  On further questioning, he
states that he has been febrile in the past week up to 101-102.

IMAGING:
NON-CON CT HEAD [**2178-12-2**]:
FINDINGS: Bilateral subdural collections are noted along the
cerebral
hemispheres. The left sided collection is mostly hypodense and
chronic appearing though a small amount of hyperdensity is noted
along the posterior and inferior aspect, suggesting an acute
component. This collection measures up to 2.1 cm in thickness.
There is diffuse left sulcal effacement and subfalcine
herniation with 10- mm righward shift of midline structures
(2:16). A chronic appearing right-sided subdural collection is
also noted measuring approximately 11 mm in maximal thickness. A
few areas of linear high attenuation are noted within this
collection which may represent subdural membranes or a small
component of acute bleeding. Associated mass effect is noted
with diffuse right sulcal effacement. Slightly hyperdense
appearance of the tentorium may be due to calcification, less
likely trace layering SDH. There is no evidence of
transtentorial herniation with patent basilar cisterns.
.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation is preserved, and there
is no
hydrocephalus. Calcification of the cavernous portions of the
carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries bilaterally is
noted. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
appear well aerated aside from a small amount of mucosal
thickening within the left maxillary sinus. The soft tissues and
osseous structures are intact.
.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral chronic subdural hematomas, left greater
than right,
with small acute component (more evident on the left).
Associated mass effect with rightward shift of midline
structures and diffuse sulcal effacement.

[**2115-5-17**] CXR:Compared to the prior study, there is increase in
pulmonary edema in both lungs with increased bibasilar opacities
that most likely represent the lung volume overload rather than
interval development of infectious process or aspiration. The
pleural effusion has increased, but left more than right, which
is slightly unusual and that is why it should be closely
followed. Some of the lung opacities have nodular appearance but
given its rapid development are most likely representing
pulmonary edema than an infectious etiology. The evaluation of
the patient after diuresis is highly recommended to exclude the
remote possibility of underlying infection. The patient is after
left upper abdomen surgery.

[**2115-5-18**] CXR:
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess CHF after diuresis.

Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

There is mild improvement in moderate pulmonary edema, although
right upper
lobe has increasing opacity. Atelectasis in the left base,
improved. Small
bilateral effusions, increased on the right. Cardiomegaly is
unchanged.

[**2115-5-17**] Renal U/S:
FINDINGS: Right kidney measures 11.4 cm. No evidence of right
hydronephrosis. Right main renal artery and main renal vein are
patent.
Doppler evaluation is markedly limited due to continuous
respiratory motion throughout the examination. Patient is status
post left nephrectomy. The left renal fossa is unremarkable.
Bladder is not visualized due to overlying bowel gas.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Right main renal
artery and
vein are patent. Doppler evaluation of the right kidney is
markedly limited due to continuous respiratory motion.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo female admitted with SOB, URI symptoms and dietary
indiscretion over the [**Holiday **] holiday now with acute worsening of
hypoxia [**3-4**] acute CHF.

# SOB: Cardiac biomakers were flat so unlikely secondary to acs.
SOB though to represent both pneumonia and acute on chronic CHF
exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion over the
[**Holiday **] weekend. Patient was initially started on Azithromycin
and Ceftriazone for antimicrobial coverage. Patient was given IV
lasix on the medicine floor but only diuresed about 1 L.
Overnight on HD#2 she became progressively more hypoxic despite
diuresis. ABG revealed alkalosis and severe hypoxia. CXR was
consistent with worsening pulmonary edema and worsening
pneumonia. EKG was unchanged. Patient was transferred to the
CCU. In the CCU patient was diuresed with IV lasix after which
she was less SOB and O2 requirement trended down. She remained
AF and had no leukocytosis so antibiotics were stopped as it was
felt her SOB was likely [**3-4**] diastolic CHF exacerbation. She was
placed on lasix 120 mg PO three times daily and her fluid
balance was negative more than 2 liters in one day so the dose
was dropped to twice daily. Her O2 requ","4280, 5849","Congestive heart failure, unspecified; Acute kidney failure, unspecified",2

Nausea and generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, CAD, diabetes and
peripheral vascular disease with LE ulcerations presenting with
nausea and generalized weakness.  The patient's overall health
and functional status have been declining over the last [**4-29**]
weeks, described by the family as decrease in walking due to
sense of instability, difficulty with stairs, difficulty
writing, insomnia and general tiredness, including falling
asleep during ADLs and frequently during the day.  Her
cognition, in general, has been intact until recently when her
family has noted mild clouding.

Her brother passed away three days ago and the patient was able
to travel to the funeral in [**Hospital1 789**].  Per her family, she has
been eating and drinking normally, and taking her medications.
She complains of leg pain and pain in her bottom.  On the day of
admission, she was in her most recent normal state of health.
She ate breakfast and took all her pills. She tried to have a BM
prior to a lunch party and was unable to get off the commode.
She complained of nausea, shortness of breath and dizziness.
Her family notes that she was particularly fatigued after this
and would fall asleep while speaking.  They called her PCP who
recommended she come to the ED for evaluation. She normally sits
on the toilet for 1-2 hours per day, and did this today, but
when she went to get up she felt weak, nauseated and slightly
short of breath.  She presented to the ED for evaluation.

In the ED, vitals were:  98.8 58 110/70 18 100.  Laboratory
evaluation revealed a potassium of 2.8 for which she received 40
mEq KCl, an indeterminate troponin, CRI at baseline renal
function, and a leukocytosis with marked bandemia.  She was
found to have cellulitis associated with chronic LE ulcerations
and was treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  CXR and UA
were unrevealing for sources of infection.  She was found to
have brown, trace guaiac positive stool.  While awaiting a bed
on the medicine floor, the patient's heart rate dipped to 39.
ECG obtained revealed a junctional rhythm.  Her blood pressure
varied between SBP 90 to SBP 170.  Her HR stabilized in a sinus
bradycardia with rate in 40s (without intervention).  Her mental
status remained stable. She complained of some back pain.  It
was reported that the patient was sleeping at the time of the
bradycardia.  She was given 1 L NS at 200 cc/hr and 1 L NS with
40 mEq KCl at 150 cc/hr.

Per HHA, right leg erythema and ankle wound new over last
several days. Other LE changes stable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old Caucasian
male with a history of schizophrenia and aspiration
pneumonia, who was transferred from his nursing home with
hypoxic respiratory failure after a witnessed aspiration
event.  Per the nursing note, the patient choked on honey
thick [**Location (un) 2452**] food at lunch with moderate amounts of food
suctioned from his mouth.  The patient subsequently became
hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on a 100%
nonrebreather mask.  Patient's heart rate at that time was
154, and his blood pressure was 150/90.  He was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
thought to be in CHF and was given Lasix 40 mg IV.  He then
was given Morphine 2 mg and started on a nitroglycerin drip.
His heart rate increased to the 180s and it was thought the
patient was in atrial fibrillation.  Diltiazem was given.
Patient then became hypotensive to a blood pressure of 70/65
and was intubated with plans for cardioversion.  The
patient's blood pressure subsequently increased to 122/65 and
cardioversion was aborted.  At this time, the MICU was called
for evaluation.  Also in the Emergency Department,
ceftriaxone and Flagyl were given for presumed aspiration
pneumonia.  Albuterol inhalers were given and sedation was
increased to a Versed drip.  The patient was then transferred
to the MICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. History of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Question of mitral valve regurgitation, echocardiogram in
[**2123**] revealed normal left ventricular function and no
evidence of valvular disease.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Prostate cancer status post TURP.
5. Schizophrenia.
6. Status post right total hip replacement.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Trihexyphenidyl one b.i.d.
5. Paroxetine 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Depakote ER 1000 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**] and is
dependent on staff for all activities of daily living and is
noted at times to be agitated.  The patient currently has a
corporate guardian who makes all of his medical decisions.
The patient's alcohol and tobacco history is unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.8, heart rate
120, blood pressure 88/52, respirations 24, and 100% on 100%
FIO2, pressure support of 20, PEEP of 10, tidal volumes
around 580 with a respiratory rate of 22.  General:
Intubated, sedated, and moving all four extremities.  HEENT:
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Jugular
venous pressure could not be assessed.  The patient has no
teeth.  Lungs:  Diffuse wheezing and rhonchi in the anterior
lung fields.  Heart:  Tachycardic, irregular, no murmurs, but
very suboptimal examination.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
nontender.  Extremities:  No evidence of edema, warm, and
well perfused.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cells 15.1, hematocrit 38.3,
platelets 226, MCV 89.  INR 1.2.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.3,
chloride 103, bicarb 30, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 133,
anion gap of 10.  CK 1012, MB 7, troponin less than 0.01.
Preintubation ABG:  7.44/45/105.  Post-intubation ABG:
7.27/57/110.

Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe atelectasis with a small left
effusion and possible CHF.

EKG:  MAT with a heart rate in the 140s to 150.  Q waves
evident in III and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE DURING MICU STAY:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  The etiology of the
patient's hypoxic respiratory failure was likely secondary to
his witnessed aspiration event, and the patient was intubated
in the Emergency Department and placed on clindamycin and
ceftriaxone for empiric coverage of his pneumonia.  The
patient was initiated on assist control ventilation, and was
eventually weaned to pressure support ventilation, and given
several spontaneous breathing trials.  The patient required
frequent suctioning during his initial days in the MICU.

In addition, the patient's abdomen was noted to be markedly
distended secondary to obstipation, and the patient was
disimpacted and maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen.
As the patient's abdominal distention resolved and his
secretions lessoned, his respiratory status improved.  The
patient self extubated on [**3-9**], and was immediately
placed on a high flow mask with a nasal cannula.  The patient
was continued on aggressive chest physical therapy and
suctioning, and did quite well after self extubation.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient's heart rate was noted to
convert to multifocal atrial tachycardia in the Emergency
Department in the setting of overdiuresis for presumed CHF.
The patient was started on a diltiazem drip and his
multifocal atrial tachycardia spontaneously resolved.
Several days later in the ICU, the patient's multifocal

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old
male with coronary artery disease.  He is status post
catheterization at which time the results showed a severe
greater then 95% mid left anterior descending coronary artery
stenosis, left circumflex, diffuse mild disease with obtuse
marginal probably the graft target, showed a total mid right
coronary artery occlusion with bridging collaterals. Due to
the extensive coronary artery disease the decision was made
to proceed with coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient
was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit at time intraaortic
balloon pump was placed in the patient as a bridge to the
coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient was also placed on
nitro and heparin drips.  On [**2186-1-5**] a coronary
artery bypass graft times three vessels was completed with
saphenous vein graft to distal left anterior descending
coronary artery, left internal mammary coronary artery to
obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit at which
time the IABP was discontinued as well as the Swan-Ganz
catheter on postoperative day one.

The patient did quite well and was transferred to the
Surgical floor where he continued to do well and engage in
physical therapy.  His epicardial wires and chest tubes were
removed without incident and the patient's course was
complicated by some early morning confusion, which was unlike
anything encountered at baseline.  Urinalysis,
electrocardiogram and neurological examinations were without
significant findings.  Geratology consult was asked for by
the family and they were kind enough to see the patient and
give their recommendations, but their diagnosis as well as
ours was acute delirium.  On postoperative day five the
patient was discharged to rehab in good condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Unstable angina secondary to coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft times three.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia, prominent main
pulmonary arteries consistent with primary pulmonary
hypertension.  No pleural effusions.  Blood cultures and
urine cultures were drawn in the Emergency Room.  In the
Emergency Room the patient also received linezolid x1 dose.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious Disease:  The patient has [**3-17**] positive blood
cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the source of which
was likely to be from the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] line for the
patient's Flolan infusion.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] line was
removed and the catheter tip culture was positive for
Pseudomonas.

The patient was started immediately on intravenous
ceftazidime and Tobramycin.  A left subclavian line was
placed on [**2121-9-13**].  The patient also had a further
Infectious Disease workup to identify the source of
bacteremia including a transthoracic echocardiogram and a
transesophageal echocardiogram which showed no evidence of
vegetations, but increased pulmonary artery pressures with
new bidirectional flow across the patent foramen ovale.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed because the patient
complained of some lower abdominal pain which was negative, a
urinalysis and urine culture were negative, and a renal
ultrasound was also found to be negative.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and lower extremity
edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old
male with a history of diabetes Type 2, congestive heart
failure, atrial fibrillation who presented with a two week
history of increasing progressive shortness of breath.  He
was in his usual state of health prior to two weeks ago and
he could perform all of his activities of daily living
without dyspnea on exertion.  Shortness of breath with
walking several steps or stairs has developed over the last
two weeks.  Furthermore there was increase in lower extremity
swelling after two days.  Review of systems was also positive
for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as orthopnea.  The
patient states he has never had these symptoms before.  He
denies chest pain.  There is also an increase in scrotal
swelling as well as abdominal girth associated with his
decrease in his appetite.  He is not complaining of fever,
chills, cough, bright red blood per rectum, melena, dysuria,
frequency, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes Type 2; 2.  Congestive
heart failure, there is an old discharge summary with
reference to a past ejection fraction noted at 35%; 3.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin for 17 years; 4.  Gout; 5.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone but in the same
building as his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] is retired.  He denies current
alcohol use, however, he was a ""drinker"" in the past when his
children were teenagers.  He has been a cigar smoker for the
last 50 years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was non-contributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 99.5, heartrate 69,
blood pressure 132/62, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 96%
on room air.  General, the patient is lying comfortably in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular motions
were intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck, obese.  Prominent
irregular jugular pulse.  jugulovenous pressure is not easily
discernible, however, it is elevated.  Cardiovascular,
irregularly irregular heartrate with a II/VI holosystolic
murmur at the left upper sternal border.  Respiratory,
decreased air movement and inspiratory and expiratory wheezes
at lower half of chest bilaterally.  Bibasilar crackles,
right greater than left.  Abdomen, obese, distended.
Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  Genitourinary,
pleural edema, per Emergency Department examination.
Extremities, 2+ lower extremity edema to the calf
bilaterally.  Neurological, alert and appropriate.  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact with no gross motor defects.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.5, hematocrit
34.6, platelets 158, MCV 90, differential 65 neutrophils, 21%
lymphocytes.  PT 17.3, INR 2.1, sodium 141, potassium 2.2,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 27, BUN 53, creatinine 1.4, glucose
104.  CPK 126, troponin 1.1 to 1.5, Digoxin 1.1.  Chest
x-ray, there was no evidence of congestive heart failure or
infiltrate on the examination.  Electrocardiogram, atrial
fibrillation at 77 beats/minute, poor R wave progression.
Left anterior vesicular block with left axis deviation, mild
ST increased in V1 to V2, however, the electrocardiogram is
unchanged from [**6-6**].

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 71 year old male with a history of
congestive heart failure (low ejection fraction by report),
atrial fibrillation, diabetes Type 2 who presented with
progressive shortness of breath over a two week period along
with dramatic lower extremity swelling and scrotal edema
consistent with congestive heart failure exacerbation.  The
clear chest x-ray is not surprising as this is a compensated
congestive heart failure.  Also with a troponin leak up to
1.5 which is likely secondary to strain from a heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac - The patient was admitted to
rule out myocardial infarction and to work up and treat the
congestive heart failure exacerbation.  Diuresis was begun
with intravenous Lasix with good response.  A transthoracic
echocardiogram showed markedly decreased left ventricular
systolic function with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% as
well as decrease in right ventricular systolic function.  His
clinical examination, however, was most consistent with right
heart failure with increased neck veins and lower extremi","42731, 4280","Atrial fibrillation; Congestive heart failure, unspecified",2,,,,,

ADDENDUM: This Discharge Summary will span the dates of [**2201-3-9**] through [**2201-4-5**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):

1.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was seen in
consultation by both the Liver and Renal teams.  The Liver
team did not feel that her acute renal failure was consistent
with hepatorenal syndrome.  There was not a clear diagnosis
for the renal failure; however, her renal function continued
to rapidly decline with a rise in creatinine and a decreasing
urine output.

With the patient approaching anuric renal failure, and no
clear diagnosis, the patient was sent for a renal biopsy.
The biopsy was complicated by the development of a
perinephric hematoma in the setting of her coagulopathy, felt
to be secondary to her liver disease.  The perinephric
hematoma was followed with serial ultrasounds and remained
stable throughout her course.

The biopsy results from the kidney revealed acute tubular
necrosis.  There were also some changes consistent with
chronic microangiopathic thrombotic changes as well as a
suggestion of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis;
although, the Renal team was not impressed with either of
these possibilities.

Ultimately, the patient was forced to be started on
hemodialysis for the implication of fluid overload in the
setting of worsening hypoxia.  Subsequent to starting
hemodialysis, the patient underwent a difficult and
complicated course that will be described in more detail
below; including further episodes of hypotension and the need
for contrast administration.  Ultimately, her kidney function
did not seem to be responding, and she was continued on three
times per week hemodialysis intermittently with extra
sessions of ultrafiltration for volume issues.

At the time of this dictation, the patient was still
maintained on hemodialysis with no indication of renal
recovery.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient's initial complaints did
not include many respiratory symptoms; although, she did
complain of a mild cough as well as a hoarse voice and sore
throat.

Incidentally, on a chest x-ray for a peripherally inserted
central catheter line placement, there was noted to be
bilateral interstitial infiltrates.  It was felt that these
could be consistent with a diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia; although, the patient's CD4 count was intact.

The patient was set to undergo an induced sputum, but prior
to that felt volume overload from her aforementioned renal
failure.  This episodes of hypoxia from volume overload in
the setting of the perinephric hematoma (as described above)
status post biopsy, as well as a drop in her hematocrit,
resulted in transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent a
bronchoscopy where her bronchoalveolar lavage culture data
was all negative; including negative for Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia.  Although there was a portion of lung disease
secondary to volume overload, due to renal failure, there was
evidence that these interstitial infiltrates were worsening
on follow-up imaging; including a computed tomography of the
chest.

Without a clear diagnosis, the patient was treated
supportively, avoiding intubation, and was eventually
transferred back out to the floor.  This was approximately on
[**3-22**].  That same day, the patient's cytology from her
bronchoscopy revealed suspicion for bronchoalveolar
carcinoma.

Due to this, and the still unclear diagnosis of the pulmonary
process, the patient underwent a video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure and biopsy.

On the day following the video-assisted thoracic surgery (on
[**3-23**]), the patient had an acute episode of hypoxia.
Again, there was no clear etiology for this acute change.
She was taken hemodialysis with the thought that pulmonary
edema was contributing.

Over the next few days, she became hypotensive to the 70s
systolic and was febrile.  She was treated for a possible
hospital-acquired pneumonia and underwent lower extremity
noninvasive studies which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis.

Her pulmonary status remained relatively stable with a slowly
reducing oxygen requirement until the morning of [**3-27**]
when the patient had a second episode of acute hypoxia
requiring a second transfer to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  This time requiring intubation.  The lung biopsy
finally revealed no infection, and rather a diagnosis of
bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia.

Thus, the patient was treated with intravenous steroids.  The
patient was eventually extubated on [**4-3**] and was
transferred back to regular floor on [**4-5**] on supplemental
oxygen.

3.  LIVER ISSUES:  The patient has hepatitis C and cirrhosis.
Initially, the Hepatology team was following due to renal
failure as well as worsening encephalopathy.  At that time,
they felt that her ","5990, 51881","Urinary tract infection, site not specified; Acute respiratory failure",2,,,,,

Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49 year old male with
known Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, complicated by known
esophageal and gastric varices, who presents after vomiting
one cup of blood at 7 a.m. the morning of admission.  He had
near syncope and melena but denied abdominal pain.  He
initially presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] where he was found to
be orthostatic.  His hematocrit there was 32 and he was
started on Octreotide drip and then transferred to our
hospital.

On arrival here, his heart rate was 92; his blood pressure
was 105/75; no orthostatics were measured.  He was
immediately brought to the gastrointestinal suite, where an
initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a massive amount
of blood in the stomach.  An NG tube was dropped and lavaged
to clear after two liters of normal saline.  A repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed non-bleeding esophageal
varices and a large clot overlying the stomach varices.  It
was decided to admit the patient directly to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hepatitis C cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2120**], status post
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2126-9-21**], which showed
Grade I esophageal and gastric varices.  He is listed at the
[**Hospital 9940**] Clinic for a transplant.  He has failed ribavirin and
Interferon therapy.  He has a history of hyperkalemia.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Nadolol 60 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Ursodiol 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Aldactone 100 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies alcohol.  He lives with his wife
and three children.  He works in computers.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were not
recorded.  On physical examination, HEENT:  Extraocular
motions intact.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Anicteric sclerae.  Oropharynx dry.  No blood in the mouth.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, S2,
regular rate and rhythm; II/VI systolic murmur.  Abdomen
mildly tender diffusely.  The hepatic edge is palpated three
fingerbreadths below the costal margin.  There were present
bowel sounds.  Extremities were without edema.  No asterixis.
Alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY:  At the outside hospital, the hematocrit was
33.7, white blood cell count was 8.4 and platelets were 126.
Chem-7 at the outside hospital was sodium 135, potassium 5.7,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 27, BUN 30, creatinine 1.1, glucose
95.

Calcium was 8.9, albumin 2.4, ALT 68, AST 84, alkaline
phosphatase 115, total bilirubin 2.2, INR 1.25, PTT 32.5.

EKG showed sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, no peaked T
waves.

Upon arrival to our hospital, hematocrit was 31.0, the
potassium was 5.9 and the INR was 1.4.  Total bilirubin was
2.6.  Albumin was 2.9.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 49 year old male with Hepatitis C
cirrhosis who is admitted with upper GI bleed secondary to
gastric variceal bleeding.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the
Octreotide drip was continued.  Vitamin K and fresh frozen
plasma were given to correct his coagulopathy.  Intravenous
Ciprofloxacin was given for SBP prophylaxis.  The initial
plan had been to go for a TIPS placement the next day, but
that evening, the patient developed nausea and dropped his
blood pressure to 50/palpable.  His hematocrit dropped to 28
and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a stomach filled with
fluid.

The patient therefore went emergently to Interventional
Radiology for TIPS placement, which was performed without
complications.  He received two units of packed red blood
cells which bumped his hematocrit up to 38; there was no
further bleeding.  Urine output remained adequate.  Protonix,
Ciprofloxacin and Octreotide were continued, and changed to
p.o. once he was started on a p.o. diet.  Ultimately,
Octreotide was discontinued and Lactulose was started.

He was transferred to the General Medical Floor where he did
well.  His hematocrit was stable.  Nadolol, Aldactone,
Ursodiol and Colchicine were re-instated.  He was discharged
home on the following medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ursodiol 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Aldactone 100 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Nadolol 60 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. twice a day for five days.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  He is to maintain a low salt diet.
2.  He is to follow-up in one week with the Liver Center.
3.  It was recommended that he have a repeat upper endoscopy
and echocardiogram as an outpatient shortly.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric
varices.
2.  Anemia, requiring transfusion.
3.  Thrombocytopenia.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presents for worsening angina.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old
male with history of coronary artery disease, myocardial
infarction, PTCA, chronic atrial fibrillation, and transient
ischemic attacks who developed chest pain in the beginning of
[**Month (only) 547**] of this year.  The pain resolved spontaneously but
reoccurred on [**2117-5-18**] when the patient developed persistent
chest pain.  After approximately 12 hours of discomfort, the
patient went to the [**Hospital 47**] Campus where an EKG showed
atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes.  CPK at that
time was 1510, with a 7.6 index and troponin greater than 50.
The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization at that
time which showed significant two vessel disease and an
ejection fraction of approximately 30%.  Following
catheterization, the patient was referred for surgical
intervention with the Cardiothoracic team at [**Hospital6 1760**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history includes
congestive heart failure, two myocardial infarctions,
hypertension, bladder cancer, PTCA, mild chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, transient ischemic attacks in [**2114**] with a
clot visualized in the atrium, and significant smoking
history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The past surgical history revealed
cholecystectomy, cystography, trigger finger release, PTCA,
tonsillectomy, testicle removal, and nasal septoplasty.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol 2 puffs b.i.d., Lovenox
3 mg subq. b.i.d. following the discontinuation of his
Coumadin which he had been taking for atrial fibrillation,
Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg
q.d., Prilosec 40 mg q.d., multivitamin, folate, thiamine,
and Nicoderm patch.

ALLERGIES:  Ativan causes mental status changes, Librium
causes paranoid delusions and confusion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient presented with a blood
pressure of 133/84.  The patient was in no apparent distress
and had no complaints.  The skin was intact without evidence
of rashes or breakdown.  The head was normocephalic,
atraumatic with intact cranial nerves.  The throat was clean.
There was no jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy, or
bruits evident.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The heart revealed normal S1 and S2 with an
irregularly irregular heartbeat.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended with present bowel sounds.  The
extremities were warm and well perfused without peripheral
edema.  Neurologic examination was nonfocal and grossly
intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service on [**2117-6-21**], following cardiac
catheterization and placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2117-6-22**] and
underwent a CABG times two:  To the posterior descending
artery and the left anterior descending artery.  The patient
also had mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm St. Jude's
valve.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in a stable
condition.  On postoperative day #1, the patient was afebrile
with stable vital signs.  Weans were begun on the
intra-aortic balloon pump and the ventilator.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was extubated but
continued on the intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient
postoperatively had been in a normal sinus rhythm of
approximately 70 beats per minute.  The postoperative EKG
showed 1:1 AV conduction with a PR interval of approximately
0.22.  In the middle of the day, strips showed sinus rhythm
with a complete AV block.  The patient was afterwards paced
but a strip of several seconds was obtained which showed
complete absence of P waves, absent QRS, and absent pacer
spiking.  Electrophysiology consult was obtained at this time
and the patient was increased on the V lead sensitivity to
improve the pacing of the patient's heart rate and
anticoagulation was done for the patient's persistent atrial
fibrillation.

On postoperative day #2, the patient's intra-aortic balloon
pump was discontinued and the patient tolerated this well.
The patient continued to have a junctional escape rhythm in
the 30s upon repeated attempts to discontinue the pacemaker
and observe the patient's intrinsic rhythm.  The patient's
Amiodarone was converted to 200 mg p.o. q.d. under the
direction of the Electrophysiology Service.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2117-6-25**] and
continued to do well on the floor.  The patient was placed on
Heparin drip for anticoagulation while Coumadin was held
pending possible placement of pacemaker.  The patient's heart
continued to be ventricular paced at a rate of 80.  The
patient continued to improve over the following few days and
worked well with physical therapy.  The pati","5990, 42731, 41401","Urinary tract infection, site not specified; Atrial fibrillation; Coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery",3,,,,,

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
89F with multiple medical problems who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2192-10-23**] d/t hypotension from E. coli urosepsis in setting of
poor PO intake, hypovolemia, and poor IV access/fluid
administration. Briefly, the patient is s/p recent 1 month
admission to [**Hospital3 **] for COPD exacerbation, complicated by
AIN [**12-28**] Cipro, and hypernatremia, discharged to [**Hospital 100**] rehab.
She was admitted to the MICU on [**10-23**] w/ urosepsis and
hypotension, and required dopamine and dobutamine for septic
shock with cardiogenic shock component and was given stress dose
steroids for adrenal insufficiency. She was initially treated
with Linezolid, meropenem, and gentamycin which was narrowed to
ceftriaxone once E.coli identified (completed 10 day course).
She was called out to floor on [**10-28**] and remained HD stable with
tapering of steroids (finished [**11-14**]). On [**11-6**] the patient was
hypothermic and blood cultures were drawn and demonstrated
Stenotrophomonas bacteremia; she was started on Bactrim which
was changed to ceftaz on [**11-13**] due to worsening renal failure
with plan for 14 day course.  2 days after finishing Ceftaz she
became hypothermic on the floor (temps to 91) and hypotensive.
She was transferred to the MICU on [**11-22**] - where she responded
to IVF/warming blanket.  She was started on stress dose
steroids.  Stat Abd CT only showed left pleural fluid collection
(although study inadequate due to lack of contrast).  Blood
cultures have remained negative since [**11-8**].  Urine has grown
yeast, she is s/p one dose of fluconazole for yeast in her urine
with continued yeast despite this dose. She had a renal US today
to evaluate for possible abscess and received a second dose of
fluconazole.
.
In regards to ARF, patient developed AIN at OSH d/t cipro and
was prerenal d/t septicemia. Her renal function improved daily
as HD's improved, with renal following. Developed exacerbation
while on bactrim, which was stopped. Cr drifted down to a low of
1.0, but she has been intermittently diuresed d/t whole body
anasarca, leading to worsening renal function again - lasix was
stopped on [**11-21**]. Additionally, there was concern for HIT as PF4
was positive but SRA negative so no longer on treatment with
argatroban for HIT. Also, patient has had significant whole body
edema d/t RV failure and hypoalbuminemia and she was
intermittently diuresed as above.
.
On review of systems, the patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, night sweats, fevers, chills, weight loss,
night sweats, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision,
sore throat, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, any new rashes,
denies dysuria, hematuria, increased urgency, diarrhea,
constipation, hematochezia, melena, epistaxis.  All other
systems reviewed in detail and negative except for what has been
mentioned above.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT C/A/P [**2-6**] (the day prior to admission):
IMPRESSION:  Increase in the size and extent of multiple
pulmonary nodules as well as liver masses.  Tumor thrombus
invading the upper inferior vena cava as well as the right
portal vein.  An increase in the amount of free fluid in the
abdomen and pelvis.  Increase in the size of the right pleural
effusion.  All of these findings are consistent with progression
of disease.

CXR [**2-7**]:
1. Right middle and lower lobe atelectasis with adjacent
predominantly
subpulmonic right pleural effusion.
2. Widespread pulmonary metastasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
40 yo with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the
lung, complicated by PE, IVC, portal, and hepatic vein
thrombosis on lovenox, who presented to the ED with tachypnea
and hypotension.
.
# Sepsis/Respiratory distress:
His initial presentation with hypotension was concerning for
sepsis although no clear source was found.  He was started on
vancomycin and zosyn for broad empiric coverage and his blood
pressure was supported with IV fluids and levophed.  His
respiratory distress and increased work of breathing was thought
to be compensation for his acidosis and he eventually required
intubation.  His elevated LFTs and renal function were thought
to be due to poor end-organ perfusion due to his hypotension and
improved somewhat with IV fluid resuscitation.
.
# Anemia:
He was noted to have coffee ground emesis in his NG tube and
required support with multiple transfusions of red blood cells
and FFP in an attempt to reverse his INR in the setting of
active bleeding.
.
# Dispo:
Due to his history of end-stage metastatic hepatocellular
carcinoma and his presentation to the ED with likely sepsis,
there was discussion in the ED about the appropriateness of
intubation and aggressive measures.  After discussion with the
family and the primary oncology team the decision to intubate
and treat aggressively was made.  After a day of aggressive
treatment in the ICU his labs showed minimal improvement and he
was requiring increasing amounts of IV fluid and red blood cells
to support his blood pressure and hematocrit.  A family meeting
was again held with his primary oncology team present and the
decision to stop aggressive treatment and pursue comfort
measures was made.  O","5849, 51881, 2859, 99592","Acute kidney failure, unspecified; Acute respiratory failure; Anemia, unspecified; Severe sepsis",4,,,,,

DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, sinus node dysfunction with PPM 4.03,
sarcoidosis and MGUS, who presented for right heart
catheterization and cardiac biopsy secondary to heart failure
poorly responsive to medical management.

The patient has had multiple admissions for CHF, the last of
which was in [**9-8**] at which time he had approximately 13 L of
fluid removed by CHF Solutions ultrafiltration machine.  Since
discharge he has been followed closely by [**Hospital 1902**] clinic and
undergoing biweekly nesiritide infusions, however his symptoms
have continued to worsen.  He has dyspnea with minimal exertion
(can walk approximately 20 feet) which has been progressive
since [**9-8**], but notably worse over the week prior to admission.
 He has also had a 12 pound weight gain over the 2 months prior
to admission.  He had PFTs and further pulmonary workup that was
negative.  A catheterization in [**12-8**] did not demonstrate CAD,
thought he did have moderate biventricular diastolic
dysfunction, and mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

He is now admitted for right heart catheterization for
evaluation of hemodynamics, with myocardial biopsy to evaluate
for infiltrative disease, in addition to tailored therapy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 64-year-old
man with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes
mellitus type 2, rheumatic heart disease status post aortic
valve replacement and mitral valve replacement with
mechanical valves on [**Hospital 197**] transferred from [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital **] Hospital after he presented there on [**2111-7-10**]
complaining of nausea, vomiting, and weakness for two days.

At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be
hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 70s,
hyperkalemic with potassium of 6.9, digitoxin toxic level of
2.9, and acute renal failure with BUN and creatinine of
96/10, and coagulopathic with an [**Year (4 digits) 263**] of 8.9.  Patient had
recently been admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**7-3**] with
a mild congestive heart failure exacerbation.  Patient at
that admission was diuresed with Lasix [**Hospital1 **] with good result
and discharged on [**7-5**] with a BUN and creatinine of
20/1.1.

Following discharge, the patient was taking Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **],
aldactone, Glucophage, lisinopril, which had just been
started at discharge.  One day after discharge on [**7-6**],
the patient began experiencing lightheadedness, nausea,
vomiting, weakness for which he cut his ACE inhibitor dose in
half.  Patient at this time, denied other symptoms such as
fever, chills, chest pain.

At the outside hospital, patient underwent a renal ultrasound
which was negative for hydronephrosis or other acute process.
Patient was also given D50 +10 units of insulin, 1 amp of
sodium bicarb, Kayexalate, 1 amp of calcium gluconate, all
for his hyperkalemia.  Patient was also bolused with normal
saline and put on a dopamine drip as well as a dobutamine
drip for his low systolic blood pressure to the 70s.  Patient
was also given 1 amp of Digibind for his digoxin level of
2.6.  Patient's repeat potassium was 5.6 at the outside
hospital.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient's systolic blood pressure decreased to the 60s while
in the parking lot, so his dopamine drip was increased to 5
mcg/kg/minute.  Patient at this time, also complained of
chest tightness and vomited once in the parking lot.

ADMTTING DIAGNSOIS:
Trauma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old female who
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
after falling approximately 13 steps down stairs.  She was
found unconscious and unresponsive at the scene by EMS at
which time she was intubated.  Her [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale at the
scene was 3.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] by Med-Flight and upon arrival was
intubated and sedated.

Her examination was significant for 1 mm pupils bilaterally.
Her trachea was midline.  Her chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Her examination was regular rate and rhythm.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with multiple
surgical scars.  Extremities:  she had a right foot
transmetatarsal amputation.  Emergency Room rectal
examination showed normal tone.  Heme negative.  She
underwent a chest x-ray that demonstrated no  pneumothorax or
rib fractures.  She underwent a plain film of the pelvis
which showed no evidence of fractures.  Her CT scan of the
head demonstrated a large traumatic subarachnoid bleed with
mild midline shift.  Her abdomen and pelvis CT was negative
for any gross traumatic abnormalities as was the CT of the
chest.   She had laboratory values sent at the time which
were significant for a white count of 5.6, hematocrit of 32
and platelets of 214.  Her coagulation studies were normal
with an INR of 1.0 and a PTT of 26.7.  Her blood gas was
significant for the following values - a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of
35, pO2 of 282, bicarbonate of 21 and a base excess of -4.

Upon speaking with the family her past medical history was
significant for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  She had
colon cancer, status post resection.  She had a right
transmetatarsal amputation.  She had an allergy to Compazine.
Her medications at home included Effexor, Diovan,
hydrochlorothiazide, trazodone.

She was transferred to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit after a
neurosurgical consult was obtained and a right
ventriculostomy drain was placed at the bedside under sterile
conditions.  Her ICPs were found to be in the 10 to 20 range.
At this point she was treated aggressively with labetalol to
maintain a cerebral perfusion pressure of greater than 70 and
she was treated with a ventriculostomy drain to main an ICP
of less than 20.  Despite aggressive management over the next
several days her neurological status did not improve.  She
would be taken off sedation at least once a day for sedation
holiday and demonstrated no purposeful movement.  She had
extensor posturing of the upper extremities and repeat head
CT confirmed traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and MRI of the
head was obtained which demonstrated no evidence for acute
infarction.  The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical
service and after over a week of aggressive treatment her
family felt that she would not make a meaningful recovery and
after meeting with the Intensive Care Unit team they withdrew
support on [**2165-4-8**].  The patient expired on [**4-8**].

presents with dyspnea x 2 wks which has acutely worsened since
this morning. Pt reports chronic dyspnea & cough productive of
clear sputum. For the past 2 weeks, he has felt increased SOB &
is unable to identify aggravating/allieviating factors. He tried
taking albuterol nebulizers at home without improvment. This
morning he awoke with worse dyspnea, he checked his O2 sat and
found SaO2 72% and called EMS. Enroute he was given nebs with
improvment in symptoms. He had previously been in 4-6L O2 but
since quitting, he reports O2 sats of 92% in the AM which
improve to as high as 96% with ambulation.
.
At baseline pt has cough productive of clear sputum.  There have
been no changes in its color or quantity.  His home nebulizers
have not improved his symptoms. Denies fevers, but endorses
chills, no leg swelling, orthopnea, PND, CP.  This AM, pt
checked his sat & found it was 72% on RA so he decided to call
ED.
.
On arrival to ED, oxygen 70% on RA
.
The pt was given albuterol/atrovent nebs with sats improved to
98% on the neb then 88% on 3L NC.  Peak flow 160.
.
In the ED, the patient was given methylpred 125 mg IV for likely
COPD exacerbation. Initial CXR showed evidence of new RLL
consolidation.  He was also started on azithro, cftx, levoflox,
& flagyl to cover for CAP & possible aspiration PNA.  He was
also given 500 cc IVNS.  He was noted to be tremulous and given
0.5 mg IV lorazepam for concern of EtOH w/d.
.
Pt's ABG on 10L revealed PCO2 of 57 (7.37/57/149).  He was
placed on BiPAP which transiently decreased his PO2; FiO2 was
subsequently increased (7.39/57/72 on BiPAP with 33% FiO2,
appears comfortable, increased fio2 to 40%
.
EKG showed sinus rhythm without STE/STD.

History of Present Illness:
60M with CAD s/p Omnilink bare metal stent to mid-RCA [**2-6**], EF
32%. Presented this afternoon to [**Hospital6 19155**] after
two episodes CP overnight (3:30am, 5am). Took 1 SL NTG for each
with resolution of his symptoms, and went to the ER. In the ER,
VSS: T 98.0F, BP 125/85 HR 77, RR 20, SaO2 97% RA. He was given
lopressor 2.5mg IV. Initial OSH labs were significant for CK
312(4), trop 0.01. Hct 52.4, plt 319, INR 1.3 (on coumadin), K
3.9, gluc 106. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
possible cardiac catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he stated that he has not had additional
episodes of chest pain since this am. He usually has episodes
about every 2 weeks but the episodes have been more frequent
over the past week and has had three other episodes this past
week. His chest pain awoke him from sleep at 3:30 and then 5:00
this am and he described the pain as radiating across his chest.
He also had ""the sweats"" at the time and felt dizzy. Each
episode lasted 10 minutes and was relieved by NTG.
.
Note: Approx. 1 hour after arriving to the floor, he began to
flip in and out of VT. His blood pressure was stable throughout
the episode and he appeared to flip out with valsalva but
immediately went back in. The episodes lasted 30 seconds to 1
mins. Amio bolus and drip was started and the runs of VT stopped
but he continued to have ectopy. He was asymptomatic throughout,
although scared.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Angina.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old man with
unstable angina transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital
for coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient was
recently diagnosed with coronary artery disease, catheterized
at an outside hospital, which showed 70-80% left main, severe
proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and mid
left anterior descending coronary artery with a 90% ramus,
100% right coronary artery, and proximal circumflex coronary
artery lesion with an ejection fraction of 30%, admitted to
the outside hospital with increasing chest pain, put on a
heparin drip and nitroglycerin paste.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease.  2.

18, creatinine 1.0, white blood cell count 8.6, hematocrit
34, platelet count 190, INR 1.2.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission heart rate was 68 and
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 102/60, respiratory rate 20,
alert and oriented x 3, moved all extremities.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen by cardiothoracic
surgery and scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting.
On [**2131-7-16**] the patient went to the operating room.  Please
see the operating room report for full details.  In summary,
at that time he had coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with
a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft to ramus.  He tolerated the
surgery and was transferred from the operating room to the
cardiothoracic intensive care unit.  At the time of transfer
the patient had a mean arterial pressure of 66.  He was AV
paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute.  He had dobutamine at
2.5 mcg per kg per minute, Neo-Synephrine at 0.8 mcg per kg
per minute, and propofol at 25 mcg per kg per minute.  The
patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  He
remained hemodynamically stable.  His anesthesia was reversed
and sedation discontinued, however the patient was slow to
awaken following discontinuation of his sedatives, and was
therefore ventilated during the overnight period after his
surgery.

On postoperative day one the patient was extubated in the
early AM.  All cardioactive IV medications were discontinued.
His PA line was discontinued.  He remained hemodynamically
stable throughout the day and on postoperative day two his
chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the floor
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days with the assistance of the nursing
staff and physical therapy staff, the patient's activity
level was increased.  His medications were adjusted, and on
postoperative day four it was decided that the patient was
stable and would be ready for transfer to a rehabilitation
center the following morning for continuing care.  At the
time of anticipated transfer, the patient's physical
examination is as follows:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 76
and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 16,
O2 saturation 99%, weight preoperatively 74.8 kg, at
discharge 68.9 kg.  Laboratory data showed a white count of
10.2, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 167, sodium 138,
potassium 4.1, chloride 100, CO2 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 90.  Physical examination was alert and oriented x 3,
moved all extremities, followed commands.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac was regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2 with no murmur.  Sternum was stable,
incision with staples open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with trace
edema.  Right calf incision with Steri-Strips open to air,
clean and dry.

significantly worse than baseline. On routine hepatology
outpatient labs yesterday, he was noted to have elevated Tbili
to 24(from 4.1) and elevated creatinine 2.4 (from baseline 0.9).
Per pt, he denies any fever, chills or sweats. He feels
occasionally SOB with walking at a brisk pace, but denies
worsening of this. Denies cough, chest pain or chest pressure.
He has chronic abdominal pain of 1 year's duration, ""always at

bacteremia secondary to empyema. He has a history of refractory
hepatic hydrothorax, had thoracentesis during that admission,
grew out MRSA. Chest tube was placed. Of note, TTE was neg. Pt
was treated with Vancomycin to high troughts. Infectious Disease
was involved who recommended 6 weeks total of IV vancomycin from
the start of negative blood cultures ([**5-5**], planned last day
[**6-15**]). The plan was to switch to Bactrim. However, per clinic
appt on [**6-21**], pt was not yet started on Bactrim. Notes per rehab

[**2133-5-15**] Echo: PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or
the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
septal and inferior walls. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). The right
ventricle displays moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the procedure.
POST BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine, milrione, and
norepinephrine by IV infusion. The patient is AV paced. The left
ventricle still displays moderate inferior and septal
hypokinesis but the other segments are improved compared to
pre-bypass. The left ventricular ejection fraction is about

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was evaluated and cleared by the hepatology service
with Child's Class A Cirrhosis.  He underwent the routine
preoperative evaluation.  Mr.[**Known lastname 1661**] was brought to the
Operating Room on [**2153-6-5**], where he underwent coronary artery
bypass x 3. See operative note for details.  He weaned from
bypass on Neo Synephrine and Propofol infusions.  He weaned from
pressors and the ventilator easily and was begun on beta-
blockers and diuresed towards his preoperative weight as usual.

Physical therapy worked with him, however, he was appropriate
for rehab prior to returning home.  Wounds were clean and dry
and healing. Pacer wires and CTs had been removed per protocol.
His pain was well controlled on oral analgesics. POD# 6 He was
cleared for discharge to [**Hospital **]Rehabilitation for
further increase in strength and mobility. All follow up
appointments were advised.

CT HEAD: There has been interval increase in diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage within the frontal, temporal, and
parietal lobes, left greater than right, and extending within
the sylvian fissures. There is a new large intraparenchymal
hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, measuring 6.5 cm
anteroposterior x 3.1 cm transverse with associated surrounding
hypodensity. There is new mass effect upon the entire left
lateral ventricle with approximately 6 mm midline shift to the
right. There is effacement of the frontal and occipital horns of
the left lateral ventricle. Additional note is made of
intraventricular blood products layering within the occipital
horns, unchanged. There is evidence of
left uncal herniation and transfalcine herniation. No acute
territorial
infarction is identified. Incidental note is made of a mucus
retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus. The remaining
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
CTA HEAD: The patient is intubated. The vertebrobasilar system
is
unremarkable. There is a 3 mm aneurysm at the left M3 segment.
There is a 1.5 mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm
and a 2.1 mm anterior
communicating artery aneurysm. No additional aneurysms are
identified. The
intracranial internal carotid, anterior, middle, and posterior
cerebral
arteries demonstrate a normal course and caliber without
evidence of high-
grade stenosis, occlusion, or arteriovenous malformation.

Pertinent Results:
intra-op echo [**2186-6-2**]
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal
free wall contractility.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There
is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
9. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, milrinone, phenylephrine, insulin.
AV pacing. Well-seated mechanical valve in thje mitral position
with characteristic washing jets. Well-seated annuloplasty ring
in the tricuspid positipon. TR is now mild. Mildly depressed RV
function on inotropic support. LVEF is 65%.
