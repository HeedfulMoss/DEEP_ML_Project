Service: CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 76 year-old female
with coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [YEAR] and multiple percutaneous interventions
who was brought to the Emergency Department after a witnessed
cardiac arrest. The patient was in the mall and had a
witness cardiac arrest. There was bystander CPR at two
minutes and after eight minutes an AED arrived and the
patient was shocked. CPR continued for five to six minutes
and then EMS arrived. Initial rhythm was complete heart
block and the patient was treated with epinephrine. This led
to ventricular tachycardia and the patient was shocked
leading to a rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, which
converted to sinus rhythm after two further shocks.
Electrocardiogram showed inferior ST elevations and lateral
ST depressions. The patient was intubated and brought to the
Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department she was
treated with heparin and Integrilin, but this was
discontinued due to coffee ground emesis. A chest x-ray
showed a right pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed. The
patient became hypotensive and Dobutamine and Levophed were
started for blood pressure support. The patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and the pressors were
weaned off with fluid boluses.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [YEAR], multiple PCIs and a redo coronary
artery bypass graft in [YEAR].
4. Bladder prolapse.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Pulse 100 to 120. Blood
pressure 60 to 80/40 to 60. Oxygen saturation 86 to 90% on
the ventilator. Her heart was regular with no murmurs.
There were rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally. The
abdomen was benign and there was no edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit status post cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The
main concern of the family from the time of admission was the
patient's wishes regarding end of life care and previous
discussions suggesting that she wished not to be intubated or
resuscitated. After extensive discussions with the family it
was determined to give the patient 48 hours to determine,
which direction her neurologic status would go. The
neurology consult team followed throughout the
hospitalization and while she initially showed some positive
signs by [DEIDENTIFIED] it appeared that the patient was not
going to make a rapid recovery back to her baseline
functional status as she would have wished. Additionally the
patient's respiratory status was compromised both by right
pneumothorax secondary to rib fracture sustained during CPR
as well as probable aspiration pneumonia. On [DEIDENTIFIED]
another meeting with the patient's two sons and daughter was
held. They believed firmly that it would be their mother's
wishes to withdraw care as she never wished to have her life
sustained with heroic measures. Therefore in the afternoon
of [DEIDENTIFIED] the patient's mechanical ventilation was
discontinued and she quickly had a respiratory arrest. The
patient was pronounced dead at 2:40 p.m. The family declines
postmortem examination.

Pertinent Results:
[DATE]
PT 21.4 INR 3.14 PTT 36.8
Serum tox neg
HEAD CT
[DATE] - Large R basal ganglia/frontal lobe intraparenchymal
hematoma (3.7x7.8) w/associated edema and moderate (1.1cm)
midline shift leftward. Large R intraventricular hematoma and
small L intraventricular hematoma
[DATE] - Slight worsening surrounding cytotoxic edema
surrounding the R frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Worsening
intraventricular
hemorrhage.
[DATE] - stable
EEG
[DATE] - Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
indicate a
widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and
subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are among the most common causes. There were no areas
of
prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features
BILATERAL LE ULTRASOUND
[DATE] - Occlusive superficial venous thrombosis w/in R greater
saphenous vein extending to 1 cm from the junction with the
common femoral vein. Non-occlusive superficial venous thrombosis
of the L lesser saphenous vein
[DATE] - Interval resolution of thrombus w/in
L lesser saphenous vein. Occlusive thrombus w/in the R greater
saphenous vein, now extending into the R common femoral vein.
ECHO
[DATE] - Normal LV systolic function, EF>55%. No valvular mass
or vegetation seen. Mild AR, trivial TR.
REPEAT CT SCAN [DEIDENTIFIED]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is approximately
stable in size.
The degree of mass effect is approximately unchanged.
2. Small amount of intraventricular blood.
3. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man on Coumadin with very large R basal ganglia
hemorrhage (>100cc) with
intraventricular extension. Hypertension (in the setting of
elevated INR) is the most likely etiology of the hemorrhage
given the patient's history and the location of the bleed.
Additional possibilities include AVM, aneurysm, or mass lesion.
Neuro - Increased intracranial pressure was initially managed
with hyperventilation and Mannitol. The Pt was sedated with
Propofol until [DEIDENTIFIED]. He was loaded with Dilantin on admission.
Dilantin was discontinued on [DEIDENTIFIED] due to concerns for drug fever
(see ID course). No seizure activity observed off of
anti-epileptic medications. After approximately three weeks
since admission, the patient began to have signs of improvement
of neurological status. He began following commands to raise
his hand, and several days later, openned his eyes spontaneously
and was moving his right side purposefully. According to
nurses, he was able to talk a bit, although this was not
observed by our team. See ""Physical exam"" section for discharge
exam.
CV - Blood pressure initially controlled with Labetalol gtt.
Transitioned to Metoprolol, Diltiazem was added for improved
rate control of intermittent atrial fibrillation. The week of
[DEIDENTIFIED], he had increased heart rate with low blood
pressures, and was unable to tolerate these antihypertensives.
His cardiologist Dr. [NAME] was [NAME], and with his
suggestion, the patient was loaded with digoxin and started on
0.125 mg each day of digoxin. He tolerated this dose well, and
when his heart rate trended up the following week, the digoxin
dose was increased to 0.250 mg. Diltiazem was continued but
with strict holding parameters for sbp<105 (and hr 60).
Metoprolol was discontinued, as his blood pressures had dropped
to the 80s systolic.
Resp - The patient was intubated initially and ventilated. A
tracheostomy was placed on [DEIDENTIFIED]. He was eventually weaned off
ventilator support to O2 via trach collar and mask. He was
tolerating 20% FiO2 on the day of discharge, with plans to wean
O2 further to tolerate sats<93%.
FEN/GI - Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed on [DEIDENTIFIED],
currently tolerating feeds well.
ID - At the time of admission, Pt was being treated with Keflex
for a LLE cellulitis. Started Cefazolin IV. Became febrile on
[DEIDENTIFIED] despite resolving cellulitis. Remained febrile through
[DEIDENTIFIED]. Treated with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin during this time
period, initially empiric treatment for presumed aspiration
pneumonia. However fever persisted after CXR improved and weaned
from ventilator support. Extensive fever workup (in conjunction
with consulting ID service) included multiple negative blood,
urine and sputum cultures, negative Cdiff, negative
chest/abd/pelvis CT, and negative echocardiogram (no
vegetations). One out of >10 blood cultures grew two colonies
of coag negative staph at >24hours, thought to represent a
contaminated specimen. Drug fever was considered, but fever
persisted after discontinuation of Dilantin. All central lines
were removed and cultured as well. Fever resolved on [DEIDENTIFIED],
exact source of fever remained unclear. However, he then had a
repeat fever on [DEIDENTIFIED], and had positive lower extremity
ultrasounds for clot in the femoral vein. (See below.) Despite
treatment, he continued to spike daily. ID was involved and
suggested discontinuing all antibiotics when he had low-grade
temperatures. This was done, and within days, he continued to
spike to 101. A C-Diff that was sent earlier came back
positive, and metronidazole was started, for a 14 day total
course. Unfortunately, even seven days into treatment, he
remained febrile. This was felt to be likely related to
""central fever,"" with his intracranial damage. To be sure, a
white blood cell tagged scan was performed on the day of
discharge. This was significant for some uptake at the trach
site, which could be consistent with the presence of granulation
tissue from placement in late [DEIDENTIFIED]. This was not
considered his fever source, thus the source was considered to
be ""central fever,"" which can occur in patients with significant
head injury. His 14 day course of metronidazole should be
completed; if he is febrile (as he has been every night),
central fever should be considered the primary cause. If
infection is suspected, other markers should be used for
workup-- ie, increased secretions or cough, low O2 sats,
diarrhea, hematuria, etc. rather than fever. CBC should be
checked, and the trach site should be inspected.
Heme: Coagulopathy (INR 3.2) on admission was reversed with FFP,
Proplex, and three day course of Vitamin K. Received additional
FFP prior to PEG placement. Superficial LE thrombi, now with
non-occlusive thrombus in the R common femoral vein. HCT stable.
 On [DEIDENTIFIED], lower extremity ultrasounds were performed to look
for lower ext DVTs and initially found superficial clot only.
Repeat scan 10 days later showed extension of the right
superficial saphenous clot into the common
femoral(non-occlusive). This alone may cause low grade fevers.
Based on this, we felt he needed protection from PE. Given that
his bleed is several weeks ago, we felt comfortable slowly
restarting coumadin. This was done slowly and he was closely
monitored for rebleeding.
Renal - Creatinine increased to a max of 3.0 on [DEIDENTIFIED]. Mannitol
and Captopril were stopped, and the creatinine returned to
baseline of 0.6-1.0, where it has since remained.
Ortho - Pt was found down. C-spine imaging negative for
fracture, but patient must be awake and able to answer ""yes"" or
""no"" to pain in order for his c-spine to be cleared. For this
reason, he remains in a collar. At rehab, once he is able to do
this without the collar, the collar may be discontinued.
Endo - Normoglycemia maintained with insulin sliding scale as an
inpatient.
Prophylaxis - pneumoboots, coumadin, bowel regimen, prevacid.
Dispo - for discharge to [HOSPITAL] rehab facility.

workup-- ie, increased secretions or cough, low O2 sats,
diarrhea, hematuria, etc. rather than fever. CBC should be
checked, and the trach site should be inspected.
Heme: Coagulopathy (INR 3.2) on admission was reversed with FFP,
Proplex, and three day course of Vitamin K. Received additional
FFP prior to PEG placement. Superficial LE thrombi, now with
non-occlusive thrombus in the R common femoral vein. HCT stable.
 On [DEIDENTIFIED], lower extremity ultrasounds were performed to look
for lower ext DVTs and initially found superficial clot only.
Repeat scan 10 days later showed extension of the right
superficial saphenous clot into the common
femoral(non-occlusive). This alone may cause low grade fevers.
Based on this, we felt he needed protection from PE. Given that
his bleed is several weeks ago, we felt comfortable slowly
restarting coumadin. This was done slowly and he was closely
monitored for rebleeding.
Renal - Creatinine increased to a max of 3.0 on [DEIDENTIFIED]. Mannitol
and Captopril were stopped, and the creatinine returned to
baseline of 0.6-1.0, where it has since remained.
Ortho - Pt was found down. C-spine imaging negative for
fracture, but patient must be awake and able to answer ""yes"" or
""no"" to pain in order for his c-spine to be cleared. For this
reason, he remains in a collar. At rehab, once he is able to do
this without the collar, the collar may be discontinued.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG Tube placement [DEIDENTIFIED]
Tracheostomy, trach mask [DEIDENTIFIED] HPI: Pt is a 67 year old man with hypertension, prior MI, on
Coumadin, who developed slurred speech this AM. Later found by
his wife on the bathroom floor, poorly responsive with left
sided weakness. c/o headache upon arrival to the [HOSPITAL]
ED. Head CT revealed large R intraparenchymal hemorrhage. INR
3.1;
received VitK x1. Also received Ativan 1mg x1 and Labetalol 15mg
x1. Intubated (Versed 6mg, Succinylcholine 125mg)prior to
transfer to [HOSPITAL].
In the [HOSPITAL] ED, repeat head CT obtained. Received FFP 1 unit, also
received Factor IX complex (includes Factor VII). Loaded with
Dilantin 1000mg. DIAGNOSIS: Right Frontal Lobe Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
Central Fever
Left Lower extremity cellulitis
Atrial fibrillation
C. Difficile (on Flagyl)
Deep vein thrombosis IMPRESSION: 1. Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is approximately
stable in size.
The degree of mass effect is approximately unchanged.
2. Small amount of intraventricular blood.
3. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. COURSE: 67 year old man on Coumadin with very large R basal ganglia
hemorrhage (>100cc) with
intraventricular extension. Hypertension (in the setting of
elevated INR) is the most likely etiology of the hemorrhage
given the patient's history and the location of the bleed.
Additional possibilities include AVM, aneurysm, or mass lesion.
Neuro - Increased intracranial pressure was initially managed
with hyperventilation and Mannitol. The Pt was sedated with
Propofol until [DEIDENTIFIED]. He was loaded with Dilantin on admission.
Dilantin was discontinued on [DEIDENTIFIED] due to concerns for drug fever
(see ID course). No seizure activity observed off of
anti-epileptic medications. After approximately three weeks
since admission, the patient began to have signs of improvement
of neurological status. He began following commands to raise
his hand, and several days later, openned his eyes spontaneously
and was moving his right side purposefully. According to
nurses, he was able to talk a bit, although this was not
observed by our team. See ""Physical exam"" section for discharge
exam.
CV - Blood pressure initially controlled with Labetalol gtt.
Transitioned to Metoprolol, Diltiazem was added for improved
rate control of intermittent atrial fibrillation. The week of
[DEIDENTIFIED], he had increased heart rate with low blood
pressures, and was unable to tolerate these antihypertensives.
His cardiologist Dr. [NAME] was [NAME], and with his
suggestion, the patient was loaded with digoxin and started on
0.125 mg each day of digoxin. He tolerated this dose well, and
when his heart rate trended up the following week, the digoxin
dose was increased to 0.250 mg. Diltiazem was continued but
with strict holding parameters for sbp<105 (and hr 60).
Metoprolol was discontinued, as his blood pressures had dropped
to the 80s systolic.
Resp - The patient was intubated initially and ventilated. A
tracheostomy was placed on [DEIDENTIFIED]. He was eventually weaned off
ventilator support to O2 via trach collar and mask. He was
tolerating 20% FiO2 on the day of discharge, with plans to wean
O2 further to tolerate sats<93%.
FEN/GI - Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed on [DEIDENTIFIED],
currently tolerating feeds well.
ID - At the time of admission, Pt was being treated with Keflex
for a LLE cellulitis. Started Cefazolin IV. Became febrile on
[DEIDENTIFIED] despite resolving cellulitis. Remained febrile through
[DEIDENTIFIED]. Treated with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin during this time
period, initially empiric treatment for presumed aspiration
pneumonia. However fever persisted after CXR improved and weaned
from ventilator support. Extensive fever workup (in conjunction
with consulting ID service) included multiple negative blood,
urine and sputum cultures, negative Cdiff, negative
chest/abd/pelvis CT, and negative echocardiogram (no
vegetations). One out of >10 blood cultures grew two colonies
of coag negative staph at >24hours, thought to represent a
contaminated specimen. Drug fever was considered, but fever
persisted after discontinuation of Dilantin. All central lines
were removed and cultured as well. Fever resolved on [DEIDENTIFIED],
exact source of fever remained unclear. However, he then had a
repeat fever on [DEIDENTIFIED], and had positive lower extremity
ultrasounds for clot in the femoral vein. (See below.) Despite
treatment, he continued to spike daily. ID was involved and
suggested discontinuing all antibiotics when he had low-grade
temperatures. This was done, and within days, he continued to
spike to 101. A C-Diff that was sent earlier came back
positive, and metronidazole was started, for a 14 day total
course. Unfortunately, even seven days into treatment, he
remained febrile. This was felt to be likely related to
""central fever,"" with his intracranial damage. To be sure, a
white blood cell tagged scan was performed on the day of
discharge. This was significant for some uptake at the trach
site, which could be consistent with the presence of granulation
tissue from placement in late [DEIDENTIFIED]. This was not
considered his fever source, thus the source was considered to
be ""central fever,"" which can occur in patients with significant
head injury. His 14 day course of metronidazole should be
completed; if he is febrile (as he has been every night),
central fever should be considered the primary cause. If
infection is suspected, other markers should be used for
workup-- ie, increased secretions or cough, low O2 sats,
diarrhea, hematuria, etc. rather than fever. CBC should be
checked, and the trach site should be inspected.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
#Afib -- She has had decreased po intake for the last 2 weeks
due to mouth pain resulting in severe hypovolemia on
presentation. The combination of hypovolemia and medication
noncompliance likely led to her atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. She received 4L IVF in the ED and 2 more
in the CCU. She was initially maintained on a diltiazem drip.
She converted to NSR a few hours after admission so her
diltiazem drip was stopped and she was transitioned to
metoprolol with her home regimen of digoxin. She remained in
NSR with episodes of SVT on metoprolol 25 tid and digoxin 0.125.
 She was somewhat resistant to care here, refusing medications
on occasion. She was opposed to drastic change in her
medication regimen as an inpatient. She should likely be
considered for amiodarone and ablation but is currently
refusing. She was started on Toprol XL in an effort to improve
medication compliance with once-daily dosing. She was
discharged on her home digoxin as well. The importance of
continuing these medications was stressed to the patient and her
family. Per her outpatient cardiologist, she is not a candidate
for anticoagulation due to risk of bleeding.
.
#CAD -- No active ischemia. Continued on her outpatient regimen
of aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. She was started on
Toprol XL as above.
.
#Oral cancer -- Much of patient's problems have come from her
inability to take medications secondary to severe oral pain and
odynophagia s/p XRT. She was maintained on a Fentanyl patch.
The dose was increased to 50mcg but she had mild delirium with
this dose, so she was dropped back down to her home regimen. In
addition, she was offered lidocaine swish and swallow as well as
GelClair and magic mouthwash for symptomatic relief. She was
intermittently compliant with these medications. She was
discharged with prescriptions for these meds, and is scheduled
for Oncology follow up 5 days after discharge.
.
#Renal insufficiency -- Baseline cr 0.5-0.8, Cr decreased fom 1
to 0.6 with IV hydration initially. It was 1.0 on the day of
discharge. The importance of adequate fluid intake was stressed
to the patient and her family.
.
#Anemia -- Microcytic anemia with baseline hematocrit of 26-30.
Studies indicate iron deficiency; patient non-compliant with
iron at home. She was maintained on iron supplements and
further workup was deferred to the outpatient setting.
.
# Leukopenia: Her WBC count was noted to be 1.7 the day after
admission. Her baseline WBC count appears to be 4-7,000. She
was not neutropenic by ANC. She was not started on any
medications suspicious for causing leukopenia. She has not
received any chemotherapy. She had 1 isolated temperature of
100.4, but no infectious symptoms. She was started on
ciprofloxacin for a suspected UTI by UA. Her leukopenia in
combination with her anemia may be suspicious for MDS. She will
be following up with her oncologist in 5 days and should likely
have a CBC checked at that time. She was instructed to contact
her oncologist should she have a temperature >100.4.

Mrs [NAME] is a 66 yo woman with ESRD on HD, c/b calciphylaxis,
afib on [NAME], who c/o generalized weakness x2-3 wks now
presents with tarry stools and hypotension. Pt states that she
had a large, black, tarry BM this morning, then went to [NAME]
today and was feeling weaker than usual, requiring help with
ambulating. She was hypotensive and INR was found to be
elevated to 19, therefore she was referred to the ED for further
evaluation. Pt [NAME] other symptoms including fever, however
does state that she has had watery diarrhea 4x/day for the last
several days, also c/o decreased appetite. She has also been
feeling lightheaded. She [NAME] changes in her diet recently
and does not think that she could have accidentally overdosed on
her [NAME].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.5 104 80/23 18 100% 4L

guiac + stool, gastric lavage showed no evidence of bleeding.
Labs were notable for a crit of 20.2, INR was 19.2. She was
given pantoprazole, dilaudid, 2U PRBCs, 2 U FFP, 2 U fluids. 2
18 gauge periph IVs were placed. Chest xray was without
effusion or consolidation, L-sided [NAME] line in place. She
was seen by renal and GI in the ED who will continue to follow
on the floor.
.
On the floor, pt is alert, oriented, c/o pain in legs, otherwise
asmptomatic.

EGD [DATE]:
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. A physical exam was performed prior
to administering anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The
patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an
endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under
direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was
reached. Careful visualization of the upper GI tract was
performed. The vocal cords were visualized. The Z-line was noted
at 39 centimeters.The diaphragmatic hiatus was noted at 40
centimeters.The procedure was not difficult. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
History:
66 yo woman with hx ESRD on HD, afib, presenting with weakness,
hypotension and melena concerning for GIB. INR at admission
found to be >19. Pt was admitted to the ICU s/p 6U transfusion.
Bleeding resolved with IV PPI. UGI endoscopy normal. Hct stable
for 10days. Hospital course c/b with calciphylaxis (lower
extremity) on sodium thiosulphate and [DEIDENTIFIED] (breast). Pain
management has been challenging. She has been on IV dilaudid
PCA, fentanyl patch and standing tylenol. D/ced to rehab on
Lovenox for anticoagulation, sodium thiosulfate for
calciphlaxis, po dilaudid, fentanyl patch and acetaminophen for
pain.
#. Calciphylaxis and [DEIDENTIFIED] Necrosis: Breast lesions biopy c/w
[DEIDENTIFIED] necrosis. Lower extremity lesions c/w with
calciphylaxis based on previus biopsy and bone scan. [DEIDENTIFIED]
stopped upon admission. Calciphylaxis managed on sodium
thiosulfate. This may need to be continued for another 6 weeks
or more. *Please order this medication ahead of time as there is
a national shortage(
#. Chronic pain: Pain management had been challenging throughout
hospital course. Pt continues to have pain despite 0.25-0.36mg
dilaudid PCA q6mins, with 12.5-100mcg/hr fentanyl patch, and
standing 1000mg tylenol q8hr/prn. Pain service and palliative
care both involved in her care. We will continue her on
gabapentin, tylenol 1000mg q8hr/prn, fentanyl patch 25mcg/hr
q3days, and po dilaudid 2-4mg q3hrs upon discharge to rehab. She
had been monitor for mental status and respiratory depression
closely with medication adjustment. Please hold dilaudid if
repiratory rate <10 or changes in mentation, or somnolance.
.
#. Afib, coagulopathy:
Held [DEIDENTIFIED] on admission given GIB and supratherapeutic INR,
which was reversed. [DEIDENTIFIED] was not restarted given [DEIDENTIFIED]
necrosis on the breasts. Additionally, she reportedly had an
adverse reaction to Plavix in the past. After much discussion
with patient, family, pharmacy and renal, we decided to start
her on Lovenox. The pharmacokinetics of this medication are
unclear in [DEIDENTIFIED] (and obesity). Accordingly, she will be
dosed 80mg q48hr with trough anti10a monitoring prior to each
dose. Goal anti10a level between 0.2-0.4. If there are problems
running this test, please send test to [HOSPITAL].
#. Acute Blood Loss anemia due to GI bleeding:
Pt Hct drop of 15 points below most recent baseline. NGL in ED
was negative. However, pt had reported melena, concerning for
upper source. Elevated INR likely a contributing factor as
supratherapeutic to 19 on admission. Her INR was reversed with
FFP and vitamin K. She was transfused 2 units of units PRBC's in
the ED and an additional 4 units while in the ICU. She was also
started on IV PPI. GI was consulted, and EGD showed no active
bleeding, presumed due to PPI therapy. She was started on
Omeprazole 20mg [HOSPITAL] and. Her Hct stabilized without any repeat
bleeding throughout the rest of her course.
#ESRD
Hemodialysis was continued with consultation by Dr. [NAME],
her nephrologist. Medications were renally dosed.
#Constipation
She was markedly constipated during her admission, finally
having multiple BM's with large doses of PEG as well as colace,
senna. This was due to the high-dose opiates she was receiving.
TRANSFER OF CARE
1. Continue sodium thiosulfate 3x a week 25mg IV over 30mins
with Zofran after HD for treatment of calciphylaxis.
2. Continue wound care the skin lesions to prevent
superinfection. Pt is at high risk for bacteremia and sepsis.
3. AVOID caustic [DOCTOR] and aggressive debridement of skin
lesions given risk of bleeding from underlying arterial source.
4. Continue to follow pain and titrate pain medication.
5. CLOSE MONITORING for mental status changes and respiratory
depression closely with pain medication adjustment.
6. Continue to monitor for rebleeding from GI tract while on
Lovenox.
7. Continue PO omeprazole and transition to daily upon discharge
from rehab or at next PCP [NAME].
8. Please hold dilaudid if repiratory rate <10 or changes in
mentation, and somnolance.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [NAME],
It was a pleasure taking care of you when you were admitted to
[HOSPITAL] for gastrointestinal bleeding. At admission, we found that
your INR was elevated at >19 and that your labs indicated that
you had significant blood loss. We stopped your Warfarin
(coudmadin), gave you blood, and treated you with intravenous
proton pump inhibitor for a suspected gastric ulcer. An
endoscopy was performed to assess the upper portion of your
intestinal tract, but did not find any source of bleeding. You
did not show any signs of further blood loss during your
hospital course, and your labs showed a stable hematocrit for
the past 10days.
The second issue during your hospital course was your skin
lesions on your Right breast and thigh. You had a biopsy of the
lower extremity lesions from [DEIDENTIFIED], which showed calciphylaxis.
We also did a bone scan which was consistent with this
diagnosis. Dermatology team biopsied your right breast lesion
and found that it was consistent with [DEIDENTIFIED] necrosis. There
had been extensive discussion on which anticoagulation regimen
we will send you home with. Since you are no longer able
tolerate [DEIDENTIFIED] and have a history of adverse reactions to
plavix, we will discharge you on Lovenox for your
anticoagulation. We treated you with sodium thiosulfate for your
calciphylaxis, and you will continue on this as an outpatient.
Pain management and palliative care were both involved for the
management of your pain. We will send you to rehab with a pain
management plan below, which may be adjusted and titrated
according to your pain.
The medication we stopped upon your admission was:
1. Warfarin ([DEIDENTIFIED]): we stopped this medication due to a
elevated INR, as well as your skin lesions that were consistent
with Warfarin necrosis.
Upon discharge the new medication you will be continued on are:
1. Lovenox 80mg every other day: this is a medication for
anticoagulation. You will have your blood draw before getting
the next dose to ensure that anti-10a level is within 0.2-0.4.
2. Sodium Thiosulfate: you will get 25mg of this medication
after hemodialysis over a 30mins infusion period. You will
receive Zofran during this infusion. This medication may cause
hypotension, and you blood pressure should be monitored during
this infusion.
3. Fentanyl patch: you will go to rehab on 25mcg/hr of fentanyl
patch that should be changed every 3 days. Please stop the patch
if you feel lethargic, confused, or if your feel that you are
not breathing well. This may be changed at rehab.
4. Hydromorphone 2-4mg every 3 hrs: Please stop using it if you
feel sleepy, woozy, lethargic or confused. You respiration and
oxygenation needs to be monitored while on this medication. This
may be changed at rehab. This dose may be readjusted at rehab.
5. Senna, colace, miralax: these three medications are to help
you move your bowel while on the pain medications.
6. Sarna lotion and fexofenadine to help control your itching.
Other medication changes:
1. Gapapentin: we decreased this medication for 300mg qday. They
may decided to restart you on your outpatient night-time dose.
Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow up with your primary care doctor [NAME] [NAME]e from rehab

bleeding, presumed due to PPI therapy. She was started on
Omeprazole 20mg [HOSPITAL] and. Her Hct stabilized without any repeat
bleeding throughout the rest of her course.
#ESRD
Hemodialysis was continued with consultation by Dr. [NAME],
her nephrologist. Medications were renally dosed.
#Constipation
She was markedly constipated during her admission, finally
having multiple BM's with large doses of PEG as well as colace,
senna. This was due to the high-dose opiates she was receiving.

66 yo woman with hx ESRD on HD, afib, presenting with weakness,
hypotension and melena concerning for GIB. INR at admission
found to be >19. Pt was admitted to the ICU s/p 6U transfusion.
Bleeding resolved with IV PPI. UGI endoscopy normal. Hct stable
for 10days. Hospital course c/b with calciphylaxis (lower
extremity) on sodium thiosulphate and [DEIDENTIFIED] (breast). Pain
management has been challenging. She has been on IV dilaudid
PCA, fentanyl patch and standing tylenol. D/ced to rehab on
Lovenox for anticoagulation, sodium thiosulfate for
calciphlaxis, po dilaudid, fentanyl patch and acetaminophen for
pain.

calciphylaxis based on previus biopsy and bone scan. [DEIDENTIFIED]
stopped upon admission. Calciphylaxis managed on sodium
thiosulfate. This may need to be continued for another 6 weeks
or more. *Please order this medication ahead of time as there is
a national shortage(
#. Chronic pain: Pain management had been challenging throughout
hospital course. Pt continues to have pain despite 0.25-0.36mg
dilaudid PCA q6mins, with 12.5-100mcg/hr fentanyl patch, and
standing 1000mg tylenol q8hr/prn. Pain service and palliative
care both involved in her care. We will continue her on

#. Afib, coagulopathy:
Held [DEIDENTIFIED] on admission given GIB and supratherapeutic INR,
which was reversed. [DEIDENTIFIED] was not restarted given [DEIDENTIFIED]
necrosis on the breasts. Additionally, she reportedly had an
adverse reaction to Plavix in the past. After much discussion

Attending:[NAME]
Chief Complaint:
Increased lower extremity edema and change in mental status
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yo female with a history of dementia, htn,
hypothyroidism, TIA ([DEIDENTIFIED]) who is being transferred to the CCU
for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was
initially admitted overnight on [DEIDENTIFIED] to the general medicine
service. She presented from a long term care facility with
increased confusion and new lower extremity edema. Her
daugheter expressed that her mother had decreased appetite and
confusion over the last 10 days. Doctors at [NAME] nursing home
started her on Remeron. Per her nursing facility records she
gained 10 lbs in 2 days. Presumably for this reason she was
referred for a cardiology evaluation (appt scheduled with Dr.
[NAME] [DEIDENTIFIED].) However, she became increasingly confused and
unable to take [HOSPITAL] ED.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.4 73 123/91 18 97% on 4L. Patient agitated and
given haldol 5mg IV x 1. She also received 1mg IV ativan prior
to CT head which was negative. A CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions L>R and moderate pulmonary edema. ECG was read as
unchanged from prior tracing [DEIDENTIFIED]. Troponin was .29, rising to
0.36. BNP was >8000. Cardiology was consulted and felt this
troponin bump most likely attributed to heart failure rather
than ACS. Patient admitted to medicine for further work-up of
CHF.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient had a 4 L O2 requirement and
appeared volume overloaded. ABG 7.44/73/32 on 4L. She was
given 80 mg IV lasix, after which she made 700 cc urine within 1
hour. SBP fell from baseline 140s to a low of 67. Her mental
status continued to be arousable but drowsy. She was given ~100
cc NS and SBP rose into the 80s. Notably, her respiratory
status apparently improved and O2 Sats rose to upper 90s on 4L.
.
There was suspicion for pulmonary embolism as a cause of her
hypoxia. CT for PE could not be done secondary to poor renal
function. Echocardiocardiogram was done to evaluate for signs
of R heart strain, and indeed demonstrated severe RV dilatation
and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume
overload new compared to prior echo 10/[YEAR]. PA pressures could
not be estimated. Small pericardial effusion was also noted.
Heparin gtt without initial bolus was started for empiric
treatment of PE.
.
The patient's urine output trailed off to ~15cc/h, her SBP
remained in the 80s, and her mental status continued to be
suboptimal. [HOSPITAL] transfer to the CCU was initiated for workup
of new RV dilatation, apparent R sided heart failure, further
diuresis in the setting of borderline hypotension and preload
dependence, and altered mental status.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was initially lethargic and could
provide only limited information. She denied any difficulty
breathing or chest pain. She further denied nausea or abdominal
pain. Her only complaint is feeling extremely cold.

MICROBIOLOGY
[DATE] Urine Cx: No growth.
[DATE] Blood Cx: No growth.
[DATE] Blood Cx: No growth.
STUDIES:
ECG [DATE]:
Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. Indeterminate
axis. There is an SI-Q3-T3 pattern. Modest right ventricular
conduction delay pattern. Delayed R wave progression with late
precordial QRS transition. Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Findings are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested
for possible right ventricular overload. Compared to the
previous tracing of [DATE] findings as outlined are now
present.
ECHO [DATE]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right ventricular
regional function cannot be assessed. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is at least
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe right ventricular
dilation. Abnormal septal motion consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. Pulmonary pressures cannot
be adequately assessed. Preserved global systolic function.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [DATE],
severe right ventircular dilation is now present. The right
ventricle appears to have been mild to moderately dilated on
prior study, but views were limited.
CXR [DATE]:
AP chest compared to [DEIDENTIFIED], 3:46 a.m., heterogeneous
bibasilar opacification has worsened. In the setting of
progressive moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and upper lobe
vascular engorgement, this is most readily explained by
dependent pulmonary edema, but pneumonia particularly aspiration
could be contributing. Bilateral pleural effusion is at least
small. Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet
developed since [DATE] could be due to progressive
tortuosity of the innominate artery or interval development of a
space-occupying lesion, most commonly a goiter but not
necessarily benign. When feasible, clinical evaluation is
recommended.
CXR [DATE]:
Opacification at the lung bases is improving and moderate
cardiomegaly may have improved as well all pointing toward
decreasing cardiac decompensation and improving pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist left greater than
right. The greater extent of opacification at the left lung base
makes pneumonia a possibility. Leftward displacement of the
trachea at the thoracic inlet points to a space occupying lesion
such as a goiter, but requires evaluation since this is a new
finding since [DATE]. Dr. [NAME] was paged.
EKG [DATE]:
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous
tracing of [DATE] ventricular ectopy is resolved.
CTA Chest [DATE]: Dilatation of the right atrium, ventricle,
and pulmonary artery with filling defect in the main pulmonary
artery which extends into the left pulmonary arteries. There is
also bowing of the interventricular septum suggesting right
heart strain. This filling defect in the pulmonary artery could
represent a saddle embolism, however, due to the increased
density of contrast and early bolus timing, mixing artifact in
the pulmonary artery should also be considered. The case was
discussed with Dr. [NAME] and a decision to anticoagulate and
repeat the study at a later date was planned due to elevated
creatinine.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo female with dementia (AAO x [DEIDENTIFIED]), CAD s/p NSTEMI in [DEIDENTIFIED],
TIA in [DEIDENTIFIED], hypothyroidism, stable meningioma p/w increased
lethargy, weight gain, and LE edema, hypoxic to 94% 4L on
presentation found to be in acute right sided diastolic failure
secondary to pulmonary embolism.
1. Acute diastolic right heart failure: On [NAME], pt with severe
RV dilatation new since [DEIDENTIFIED], at least borderline PA systolic
HTN, and nl LVEF. LENIs negative and subsequent CTA equivocal
(saddle-embolic v. mixing artifact w/ suboptimal study) but
submassive-massive subacute PE most likely etiology of RV
failure; LV failure may have been due to RV impingement of LV
filling. Pt was started on heparin for treatment of PE, and
later transitioned to warfarin 5mg with lovenox bridging.
Lovenox was discontinued on [DEIDENTIFIED] given supratherapeutic INR of
3.2, and warfarin held [DEIDENTIFIED] and restarted at 2.5mg on [DATE].
Pt's INR to be monitored at longterm nursing facility with goal
INR [DEIDENTIFIED]. She will likely require at least a one-year course of
anticoagulation given her degree of cardiac impairment, with the
duration to be weighed against the risk of bleed. Her ASA was
decreased to 81mg daily given starting of warfarin.
2. Left heart failure: Pt fluid overloaded on presentation. [DEIDENTIFIED]
showed nl EF although some degree of diastolic dysfunction was
suspected. It was postulated that RV dilatation have been
impinging on LV filling and forward flow due to the septal wall
motion abnormality observed. Pt was transferred to CCU initially
as she became hemodynamically unstable in the setting of
diuresis, likely due to her preload dependence. In the CCU, she
was first diuresed with a furosemide drip, then transitioned to
IV boluses and with good effect. She was transferred back to the
floor after ~2.5L diuresis with stable BP and O2 sats 90-94% RA.
She appeared to have improving forward flow and on discharge,
O2sat 93% on RA and furosemide requirement 20 mg PO daily, with
possibility of weaning patient off furosemide in outpatient
setting. Patient did have some desaturation to 80s% during
night, possibly OSA, but CPAP would not be tolerated due to her
dementia.
.
3. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9. On admission,
it was 1.3, reaching a peak of 1.4 in the CCU. This was thought
secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF. This
improved back to baseline with diuresis. She did receive
Mucomyst for her CTA chest, and all of her medications were
renally dosed.
.
4. Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [DOCTOR] level of
consciousness on admission as well as intermittent
disorientation. This was likely secondary to medication effect
from ativan and haldol received in the ED as well as due to
acute illness including hypoxia and hypotension. CT head
negative; urine culture negative, and blood cultures with no
growth; TFTs nl; electrolytes nl; BUN elevated but not frankly
uremic level. Her Remeron (started recently for anorexia) was
held. Her mental status significantly improved within 48 hrs
with pt becoming more animated and interactive although she was
unable to state the season, DOB, and where she currently
resides. She did have several nights of agitation requiring
soft restraints and IV Haldol, but 2 nights before discharge,
patient slept through the night and did not require chemical or
mechanical restraints. Patient was oriented x1 by discharge,
which appears to be similar to baseline dementia.
.
5. Anorexia: Daughter and HCP reported declining ability to take
PO. Possibly secondary to worsening dementia vs. subacute
medical illness. Remeron was recently started for this, unclear
if this had been helpful. As mentioned above her Remeron was
held since it was thought to possibly be contributing to her
change in mental status. A nutrition consult was requested, and
they recommended low sodium diet of pureed solids, thin liquids,
and Ensure supplements. Because the patient did not consistently
finish PO meals, nutrition recommended 1584 Kcal/70g protein
tube feeds at 55 ml/hr if it was consistent with the patient's
goals of care. The patient's guardian [NAME] [NAME] stated that
tube feeds were not desired at this time. A speech and swallow
consult was sought since patient has dementia and is at risk for
aspiration. We encourage supervised feedings once the patient
returns to her nursing home.
.
6. Bradycardia: Pt had been on metoprolol per NH records
although this had been discontinued per her most recent PCP note
in [DEIDENTIFIED] due to possible role in TIA. She also had been noted to
have asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia to 30s in the past
which were also observed on this admission. For these reasons,
her metoprolol was once again discontinued on this admission.

Discharge Condition:
Stable
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with increased lower extremity swelling,
increased weakness, weight gain, and decreased oxygenation. You
were found to have a clot in your lung that was responsible for
fluid overload. You were initially admitted to the cardiac
intensive care unit and was treated with medications to decrease
fluid overload. You were also started on blood thinning
medications.
Please continue your home medications with the following
additions and changes:
- You need to take warfarin (Coumadin) blood thinning pills.
- You need to take furosemide (Lasix) to prevent fluid buildup.
- Please stop taking your metoprolol due to slow heart rate.
- Please stop taking your Remeron due to leading to increased
sleepiness.
Please weigh yourself daily. Please call your primary care
physician or return to the hospital if you experience any
increased shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, lower
extremity swelling, if you gain more than 3 lbs, or for any
other concerning symptoms.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None","1","This is an 84 yo female with a history of dementia, htn,
hypothyroidism, TIA ([DEIDENTIFIED]) who is being transferred to the CCU
for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She was
initially admitted overnight on [DEIDENTIFIED] to the general medicine
service. She presented from a long term care facility with
increased confusion and new lower extremity edema. Her
daugheter expressed that her mother had decreased appetite and
confusion over the last 10 days. Doctors at [NAME] nursing home
started her on Remeron. Per her nursing facility records she
gained 10 lbs in 2 days. Presumably for this reason she was
referred for a cardiology evaluation (appt scheduled with Dr.
[NAME] [DEIDENTIFIED].) However, she became increasingly confused and
unable to take [HOSPITAL] ED.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.4 73 123/91 18 97% on 4L. Patient agitated and
given haldol 5mg IV x 1. She also received 1mg IV ativan prior
to CT head which was negative. A CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions L>R and moderate pulmonary edema. ECG was read as
unchanged from prior tracing [DEIDENTIFIED]. Troponin was .29, rising to
0.36. BNP was >8000. Cardiology was consulted and felt this
troponin bump most likely attributed to heart failure rather
than ACS. Patient admitted to medicine for further work-up of
CHF.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient had a 4 L O2 requirement and
appeared volume overloaded. ABG 7.44/73/32 on 4L. She was
given 80 mg IV lasix, after which she made 700 cc urine within 1
hour. SBP fell from baseline 140s to a low of 67. Her mental
status continued to be arousable but drowsy. She was given ~100
cc NS and SBP rose into the 80s. Notably, her respiratory
status apparently improved and O2 Sats rose to upper 90s on 4L.
.
There was suspicion for pulmonary embolism as a cause of her
hypoxia. CT for PE could not be done secondary to poor renal
function. Echocardiocardiogram was done to evaluate for signs
of R heart strain, and indeed demonstrated severe RV dilatation
and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume
overload new compared to prior echo 10/[YEAR]. PA pressures could
not be estimated. Small pericardial effusion was also noted.
Heparin gtt without initial bolus was started for empiric
treatment of PE.
.
The patient's urine output trailed off to ~15cc/h, her SBP
remained in the 80s, and her mental status continued to be
suboptimal. [HOSPITAL] transfer to the CCU was initiated for workup
of new RV dilatation, apparent R sided heart failure, further
diuresis in the setting of borderline hypotension and preload
dependence, and altered mental status.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was initially lethargic and could
provide only limited information. She denied any difficulty
breathing or chest pain. She further denied nausea or abdominal
pain. Her only complaint is feeling extremely cold.","1","84 yo female with dementia (AAO x [DEIDENTIFIED]), CAD s/p NSTEMI in [DEIDENTIFIED],
TIA in [DEIDENTIFIED], hypothyroidism, stable meningioma p/w increased
lethargy, weight gain, and LE edema, hypoxic to 94% 4L on
presentation found to be in acute right sided diastolic failure
secondary to pulmonary embolism.
1. Acute diastolic right heart failure: On [NAME], pt with severe
RV dilatation new since [DEIDENTIFIED], at least borderline PA systolic
HTN, and nl LVEF. LENIs negative and subsequent CTA equivocal
(saddle-embolic v. mixing artifact w/ suboptimal study) but
submassive-massive subacute PE most likely etiology of RV
failure; LV failure may have been due to RV impingement of LV
filling. Pt was started on heparin for treatment of PE, and
later transitioned to warfarin 5mg with lovenox bridging.
Lovenox was discontinued on [DEIDENTIFIED] given supratherapeutic INR of
3.2, and warfarin held [DEIDENTIFIED] and restarted at 2.5mg on [DATE].
Pt's INR to be monitored at longterm nursing facility with goal
INR [DEIDENTIFIED]. She will likely require at least a one-year course of
anticoagulation given her degree of cardiac impairment, with the
duration to be weighed against the risk of bleed. Her ASA was
decreased to 81mg daily given starting of warfarin.
2. Left heart failure: Pt fluid overloaded on presentation. [DEIDENTIFIED]
showed nl EF although some degree of diastolic dysfunction was
suspected. It was postulated that RV dilatation have been
impinging on LV filling and forward flow due to the septal wall
motion abnormality observed. Pt was transferred to CCU initially
as she became hemodynamically unstable in the setting of
diuresis, likely due to her preload dependence. In the CCU, she
was first diuresed with a furosemide drip, then transitioned to
IV boluses and with good effect. She was transferred back to the
floor after ~2.5L diuresis with stable BP and O2 sats 90-94% RA.
She appeared to have improving forward flow and on discharge,
O2sat 93% on RA and furosemide requirement 20 mg PO daily, with
possibility of weaning patient off furosemide in outpatient
setting. Patient did have some desaturation to 80s% during
night, possibly OSA, but CPAP would not be tolerated due to her
dementia.
.
3. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9. On admission,
it was 1.3, reaching a peak of 1.4 in the CCU. This was thought
secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF. This
improved back to baseline with diuresis. She did receive
Mucomyst for her CTA chest, and all of her medications were
renally dosed.
.
4. Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [DOCTOR] level of
consciousness on admission as well as intermittent
disorientation. This was likely secondary to medication effect
from ativan and haldol received in the ED as well as due to
acute illness including hypoxia and hypotension. CT head
negative; urine culture negative, and blood cultures with no
growth; TFTs nl; electrolytes nl; BUN elevated but not frankly
uremic level. Her Remeron (started recently for anorexia) was
held. Her mental status significantly improved within 48 hrs
with pt becoming more animated and interactive although she was
unable to state the season, DOB, and where she currently
resides. She did have several nights of agitation requiring
soft restraints and IV Haldol, but 2 nights before discharge,
patient slept through the night and did not require chemical or
mechanical restraints. Patient was oriented x1 by discharge,
which appears to be similar to baseline dementia.
.
5. Anorexia: Daughter and HCP reported declining ability to take
PO. Possibly secondary to worsening dementia vs. subacute
medical illness. Remeron was recently started for this, unclear
if this had been helpful. As mentioned above her Remeron was
held since it was thought to possibly be contributing to her
change in mental status. A nutrition consult was requested, and
they recommended low sodium diet of pureed solids, thin liquids,
and Ensure supplements. Because the patient did not consistently
finish PO meals, nutrition recommended 1584 Kcal/70g protein
tube feeds at 55 ml/hr if it was consistent with the patient's
goals of care. The patient's guardian [NAME] [NAME] stated that
tube feeds were not desired at this time. A speech and swallow
consult was sought since patient has dementia and is at risk for
aspiration. We encourage supervised feedings once the patient
returns to her nursing home.
.
6. Bradycardia: Pt had been on metoprolol per NH records
although this had been discontinued per her most recent PCP note
in [DEIDENTIFIED] due to possible role in TIA. She also had been noted to
have asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia to 30s in the past
which were also observed on this admission. For these reasons,
her metoprolol was once again discontinued on this admission.","1","(per nursing facility records and OMR):

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exam under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, tumor debulking,
BSO, omentectomy, sigmoid resection w/ sigmoid-rectal end to end
reanastomosis
History of Present Illness:
61 yo W w/ho GERD/hiatal hernia, hemorrhoids, IBS admitted for
increased abdominal distention and CT showing peritoneal
carcinomatosis and sigmoid compression, likely due to ovarian
primary. Pt reports she was in her USOH until [DEIDENTIFIED] wks ago when
she noted progressively increasing abdonminal girth. She denies
any associated abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills,
but does note pencil stools and increased frequency of loose
stools, BRB on her TP (which she attributed to hemorrhoidal
bleeding) as well as increased satiety and anorexia. She has not
had any weight loss or urinary symptoms. Pt spoke with Dr.
[NAME] who suggested she increase her zelnorm dose and
follow-up with him this week for these symptoms, but the
symptoms persisted, so she came to the ED. In the ED, she was HD
stable, and CT showed large amount of asites with omental,
peritoneal, and mesenteric implants, concerning for
carcinomatosis.

CT pelvis: 1) Large amount of ascites with omental, peritoneal,
and mesenteric soft tissue implants suggestive of
carcinomatosis.
2) Soft tissue structures in the expected location of the
ovaries. If indicated, further evaluation may be performed by
ultrasound.
3) 10-cm segment of narrowing in the sigmoid colon, without
evidence of mechanical obstruction. While no infiltrating mass
is detected, it cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the general medicine
service. She was transferred to gyn oncology on [DEIDENTIFIED] for further
management of bowel obstruction and likely metastatic ovarian
cancer. She was started on IV fluid and given nothing by mouth.
She also had initial consultation with medical oncology service.
She was taken to the OR on [DEIDENTIFIED] for staging, cytoreduction, and
relief of obstruction. Her surgery was notable for extensive
tumor debulking and 6L of ascites requiring prolonged surgery.
She was admitted to the SICU post operatively for post op volume
management.
Her ICU course was notable for a blood transfusion of 1 unit to
increase oncotic pressure. Otherwise she had no acute events and
was transferred to the floor on post op day 1.
The remainder of her post operative course is as follows:
1) GI: The pt's postop course was complicated by post-op ileus.
She was kept NPO with IVF. Her IV access was lost on [DATE]
(POD 4) and a PICC was placed. Her bowel function resumed and
she was advanced to a full diet on [DATE] (POD 6).
2) Pulmonary: The pt was noted to have decreased oxygen
saturations on [DATE] (POD
4). A CTA could not be obtained as contrast could not be
administered through the pt's PICC. A V/Q scan revealed high
probability of pulmonary embolism. She was started on a heparin
gtt per weight-based protocol. She was weaned off oxygen by POD
6. She received 10 mg [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DATE]. Her INR was
then noted to be increased to 3.4 on [DATE]. Her heparin gtt
was d/c'd and she was started on Lovenox 80 mg SQ [HOSPITAL]. Her
[HOSPITAL] was held on [DEIDENTIFIED]. Her INR was then 2.3 on [DEIDENTIFIED] and she
was given 2.5 mg [DEIDENTIFIED] that night. The [DEIDENTIFIED] was
discontinued on [DEIDENTIFIED] in preparation for port-a-cath placement.
3) Renal: The pt's urine output was adequate. Her foley catheter
was maintained in place until POD 3.
4) CV: The pt's blood pressure was stable on her home regimen of
Norvasc 5 mg qd.
5) FEN: The pt's electrolytes were checked and repleted daily as
needed.
6) Access: The pt received a port-a-cath on [DATE] without
complications. Her PICC line was d/c'd on the day of discharge.
7) Psychiatry: The pt requested to be seen by psychiatry on the
day of discharge. She was evaluated and no medication was
recommended. She has outpatient psychiatric followup.
On day of discharge she was ambulating, voiding and tolerating
regular diet. Her pain was well controlled with oral
medication.

TTE ([DATE])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [DATE], the right ventricular cavity is now
dilated and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now
present. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is also
increased and a small circumferential pericardial effusion is
now present.
Mammogram ([DATE])
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse left breast skin and trabecular thickening with
associated diffuse edema of the left breast tissue. No evidence
of pathologically enlarged left axillary nodes. Differential
considerations would include fluid overload related to
congestive heart failure (unilateral in this patient who states
that she preferentially sleeps with her left side down),
mastitis, or a diffuse infiltrative process such that can be
seen with inflammatory breast cancers or lymphoma. Clinical
correlation is advised and any decision to biopsy at this time
should be based on the clinical assessment.
CT Chest w/o contrast ([DATE])
FINDINGS: The thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is extensive
atherosclerotic calcification involving the arch of the aorta
and coronary arteries. There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly
with a small pericardial effusion. Numerous mediastinal lymph
nodes measure up to 8 mm in short axis diameter are present. No
axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.
In the tracheobronchial tree, there is moderate narrowing of the
trachea and more severe narrowing of the bronchial tree,
particularly on the left, due to bronchomalacia, compounded by
extensive mucous plugging progressively increasing distal to the
left main stem bronchus, occluding the left lower lobe bronchus,
resulting in left lower lobe collapse. The left upper lobe and
lingular bronchi are clear. There is a trace left pleural
effusion.
Bilateral coarse reticulation occuring predominantly in the
subpleural region, with areas of honeycombing particularly along
the right major fissure, is consistent with moderately severe
chronic interstitial lung disease, partially fibrotic. Diffusely
increased density of the right lung when compared to the left,
and thickening of its interlobular septa is likely asymmetric
pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia. There is no
pneumothorax.
The thoracic aorta is of normal caliber, however, there is area
of fusiform dilatation within the abdominal aorta measuring up
to 3.4 cm (400B, 29). Area of linear calcification which appears
medially displaced from the left lateral wall in the aorta at
this level may represent sequelae of a penetrating ulcer or
pseudointimal calcification of mural thrombus. Evaluation is
limited due to lack of IV contrast. Limited views of the upper
abdomen demonstrate
bilateral renal cysts which are partially imaged.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
Multilevel
degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
IMPRESSION:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia, worse on the left, probably
predisposes to
extensive mucous plugging of the left lower lobe bronchus and
lower lobe
collapse.
2. Chronic, moderately severe fibrosing, interstitial lung
disease. Asymmetric pulmonary edema.
3. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly, small pericardial effusion.
4. Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta measuring
up to 3.4 cm.
Ultrasound abdomen ([DATE])
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature with no portal vein thrombosis
identified.
2. Trace of ascites.
3. Multiple bilateral simple renal cysts.
CXR ([DATE])
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant
change. The left PICC line ends in the left brachiocephalic
vein, as on the previous study. No other changes. Moderate
cardiomegaly, minimal increase in lung density at the bases of
the right upper lobe, no evidence of pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo female with history of HTN and COPD who initially
presented from her senior living center with left mastitis, but
developed SOB and hypoxia on arrival to the medicine floor felt
to be from CHF exacerbation. Hospitalization complicated by
pneumonia, Afib with RVR, Clostridium difficile colitis, low
urine output, severe anasarca, low nutrition status, delirium,
and risk of aspiration.
#. Mastitis: Patient initially presented with swelling of left
breast. Mammogram showed left breast edema c/w CHF vs. mastitis
vs. inflammatory breast cancers or lymphoma. Rash and edema
resolved with bactrim and cefazolin. No pathologically enlarged
left axillary nodes were seen on mammogram. Patient asked to
continue to discuss further outpatient repeat imaging and
screening schedule with primary care
#. Hypoxia/Aspiration/Hospital Aquired Pneumonia: The patient
had marked clinical concern upon arrival to the medical floor
because she had hypoxia to 80% on 2L nasal cannula. This
desaturation and shortness of breath was felt to be due to
aspiration event. Patient was transferred to the MICU for
several days of close monitoring. CXR showed LLL opacity.
Bronchoscopy was performed and significant for mucus plugging,
plugging was relieved with improvement of her hypoxia. She was
also treated for hospital aquired pneumonia, and completed a 7
day course of IV vancomycin and a IV ceftazidime. Her
respiratory status has improved to the point where she saturates
in the mid to high 90's on room air, but is more stable in the
mid-90s on 2L NC continuously. She may drop to high 80s without
nasal cannula. Also, with any administration of aggressive IV
fluids, she tends to third spaces/accumulate additional fluid
into her lungs and can desaturate.
#. Clostridium difficile colitis: Patient developed diarrhea
soon after getting several antibiotics for her left
mastitis/cellulitis. Stool studies were positive for Clostridium
difficile. She was treated initially with PO vancomycin and IV
metronidazole with improvement of her symptoms. Antibiotics
were later narrowed to include just PO vancomycin liquid at
125mg q6hrs . She will need to complete another 3 days of PO
vancomycin which is to be completed on [DATE]. PLEASE reassess
if still having diarrhea after completing antibiotics.
#. Thrombocytopenia: During her hospital course the patient was
also noted to be thrombocytopenic and she was evaluated by
heme/oncology service. Several ongoing studies and clinical
trend revealed that she was not thrombocytopenia due to
DIC/TTP/HUS. PF4 antibodies were negative for HIT.
Thrombocytopenia was ultimately attributed to Bactrim. Platelet
count recovered following discontinuation of Bactrim and has
remained within normal limits.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Inpatient team spoke with PCP who
reports that the patient is in chronic A fib, although she has
never required rate control in the past and had not been on
anticoagulation. HR prior to hospitalization had been in the
70-80s. On this admission, patient was very difficult to
diurese, each time an attempt was made at diursing her, she
would have A fib with RVR, likely a reflection of being so
intravascularly depleted despite looking grossly anasarcic.
Patient was started on PO diltiazem with good control of her
rate which remains in the 70-80s range predominantly. Patient
had never been on warfarin anticoagulation for a history of
falls.
#. CHF/Anasarca: She has a history of CHF, although unclear what
her EF was prior to this admission. TTE on this admission
showed preserved EF of >55%. Patient was grossly anasarcic on
this admission, likely due to both CHF as well as low albumin
(near 2.0). Attempts were made to diurese her but it would
trigger Afibrillation with RVR. In order to help mobilize her
third spaced fluids, PO nutrition was encouraged, and ACE wraps
were utilized to help in encouraging fluids to return to
intravascular space. On discharge, the edema in her arms and
legs are much improved, but she would likely benefit from
further use of ACE wraps to provide compression to her arms and
legs. She was also started on additional triamcinlone cream to
try to help with some stasis skin changes/pain associated with
severe anasarca and poor circulation issues.
#. Pain: Unclear what the exact etiology of her pain is, but she
describes a vague pain in both her legs as well as her arms at
times. Likely due to the edematous state that they are in given
her very extreme anasarca. She was initially given morphine for
the pain but transitioned to low dose oxycodone by discharge. As
above, she was also started on triamcinalone cream to help with
stasis skin changes/severe anasarca discomfort. She has done
very well and requires only minimal amounts of oxycodone for
pain control.
#. COPD: Longstanding history of COPD on admission. She was put
on ipratropium and albuterol nebs. Her desaturations (see
above) were attributed more to her pulmonary edema/pneumonia
rather than to her COPD history. On discharge her respiratory
status is stable, doing well on 2L nasal cannula with
saturations above >95% range. She will plan to continue
albuterol nebs PRN at rehab, daily Advair and will also continue
her daily nicotine patch as well. Please continue to wean oxygen
further if she tolerates.
#. Nutritional status: Patient with low albumin of 2.0, which
likely exacerbated her edema/anasarca. Per family, patient does
not eat much at baseline. Speech and swallow evaluated the
patient and found her to aspirate on thin liquids. During this
hospitalization she was maintained on a ground solid and nectar
thickened diet, but took very limited amounts of food PO. She
needs someone to actively encourage her to eat. Two attempts
were made in the ICU to place a dobhoff but patient was unable
to tolerate placement of a feeding tube. Given her anasarca,
our hope was to give her more nutrition to increase her albumin
to help in mobilizing third spaced fluids, however both patient
and family did not want a feeding tube or PEG tube to be placed.
 Nutrition being supplemented with thiamine, MVI, and Vitamin
B12.
#. Goals of care: In the week prior to her discharge, a family
meeting was called. With the help of social worker, patient
named her sons as her HCPs. She was made DNR/DNI. It was
established by the patient and family that they did not want to
have any escalation of care. The decision was also made that
they would not pursue a feeding tube for nutrition should her
nutritional status deteriorate further.
#. Delirium/Bipolar Disorder: Intermittently delirious on this
admission likely from pain vs. polypharmacy issues at times.
Once pain was under control, patient was much more lucid and
could hold short conversations. She also has a history of
bipolar disorder for which psychiatry was consulted. Since all
her home meds had been held during her ICU stay, psychiatry
thought it prudent to give her medications back slowly given her
delirium. Divalproex was restarted (sprinkles form at 250mg at
each meal for 750mg daily dose) and most recent level within
normal limits. Risperdal was recommended to be used prn for
agitation but she did not require any risperdal during her
hospital course. Patient may need to be restarted on her usual
pre-admission psychiatric medications that include 15mg
mirtazapine qhs and 50mg trazodone qhs. If possible, please
discuss with psychiatrist while at rehabilitation.
#. Acute renal failure/Oliguria: Despite being anasarcic,
patient was overwhelmingly intravascularly dry. JVP is flat.
She had very poor urine output while in the ICU. Renal labs
showed that she was incredibly prerenal. Her BUN and creatinine
would improve with administration of IVF, however given her poor
nutritional status, it would also cause for her to have more
pulmonary edema and extremity edema. On call out to the floor,
IVF's were very cautiously given during brief periods of
hypernatremia (Na peaked at 148-->143 by discharge), but
otherwise PO intake was encouraged. An albumin challenge was
also tried, but with only marginal increase in her urinary
output. Her urine output has gradually improved over the course
of her stay on the medicine floors, averaging 300-500 cc/day.
U/A consistently showed dirty urine with leuks, WBCs, and few
bacteria. Urine culture at one point showed scant amount of
yeast but otherwise showed no growth. Dirty UA was attributed
to the fact that her urine was so concentrated and she was not
treated for UTI given no new leukocytosis, fevers or other
clinical complaints of suprapubic pain, dysuria or urgency.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. You were
initially admitted with concern for a skin infection on the left
 breast called mastitis/cellulitis in addition to shortness of
breath and a cough which was felt to be from a flare up of your
known congestive heart failure.
You were given medications called diuretics and your heart
failure symptoms slowly resolved. You were also treated with
antibiotics and your breast infection improved. However, in the
setting of multiple antibiotics you developed a diarrhea
infection called C.difficile colitis. You were put on
antibiotics for this infection and will finish the course at the
[HOSPITAL].
You also developed pneumonia while you were with us and were
treated with antibiotics for this as well. Also during your
stay, you had difficulty swallowing and would aspirate. You
were put on a pureed nectar-thickened diet for this. Your
nutritional status remained poor because you ate very little
during your hospital course. Your low level of proteins made
the swelling in your arms and legs difficult to get rid of. The
nutrition team saw you in the hospital and you have been placed
on several vitamin supplements and nutritional shakes to enhance
your caloric intake.
You will be going to a rehab facility where doctors, nurses, and
physical therapists will be able to help you with all these
issues.
Please see your complete medication list and instructions below.
MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS /CHANGES:
The following medications that you were taking prior to
admission have been DISCONTINUED: atenolol, doxazosin, lasix,
lisinopril, nifedipine, detrol, mirtazapine and trazodone.
Please CONTINUE taking the following medications you were taking
prior to admission:
-Depakote 750mg daily (now in sprinkle forms with meals*, 250mg
per meal*)
-Ranatidine 150mg tablet twice daily
-Simvastatin 40mg tablet once daily
-Tylenol 650mg tablet q6 hours as needed
The following NEW MEDICATIONS have been started while you were
in the hospital:
-triamcinalone cream applied to extremities twice daily
-Hydrocerin/mineral oil cream applied twice daily to extremities
-fluticasone-salmeterol 250/50mcg inhaler twice daily
-albuterol nebulizers q4 hours as needed
-thiamine 100mg tablet daily
-multivitamin tablet daily
-oxycodone 5mg q6 hours as needed for pain (also: 2.5mg x 1 dose
as needed when moving or transporting the patient)
-heparin SC three times daily for DVT prevention
-vitamin b12 50mcg daily ([DEIDENTIFIED] 100mcg tablet)
-Vancomycin 125mg liquid q6 hours for 3 more days (discontinue
[DATE])
-2% miconazole powder -apply twice daily to sacral area
-Senna/Colace as needed for any constipation
Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. [NAME] after you are discharged from
rehab, at the [YEAR] office. [PHONE].
*Please discuss the need for additional breast cancer screening
(mammography) with your primary care physician as sometimes
surface skin changes on the breast can be a warning sign for
early breast cancers.","shortness of breath
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy","1","76 year old woman with history of HTN, COPD and psychiatric
illness presenting with increased left breast size and worsening
dyspnea on exertion. Symptoms started approximately 5 days ago
and have progressed to where her left breast is 4-6 times larger
than her right breast. The dyspnea on exertion began ~2 days ago
(patient is unable to really recall at this point) and has
worsened, now including some symptoms even with just talking
(previously had some dyspnea with exertion). Reports some cough
across past few days, unclear if productive. She denies any
chest pain, fevers, nipple discharge or specific breast pain. No
trauma.
.
On arrival in the ED her initial VS were 97.5 119/71 72 20
98/4L. Left breast noted to be enlarged and mildly erythematous.
She was started on vancomycin with concern for cellulitis. CXR
was felt to be concerning for a LLL infiltrate and she was
started on levoquin for CAP. An EKG showed slow atrial
fibrilation. A bedside echocardiogram was performed which showed
a pericardial effusion.
.
Denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, light-headedness.","1","76 yo female with history of HTN and COPD who initially
presented from her senior living center with left mastitis, but
developed SOB and hypoxia on arrival to the medicine floor felt
to be from CHF exacerbation. Hospitalization complicated by
pneumonia, Afib with RVR, Clostridium difficile colitis, low
urine output, severe anasarca, low nutrition status, delirium,
and risk of aspiration.
#. Mastitis: Patient initially presented with swelling of left
breast. Mammogram showed left breast edema c/w CHF vs. mastitis
vs. inflammatory breast cancers or lymphoma. Rash and edema
resolved with bactrim and cefazolin. No pathologically enlarged
left axillary nodes were seen on mammogram. Patient asked to
continue to discuss further outpatient repeat imaging and
screening schedule with primary care
#. Hypoxia/Aspiration/Hospital Aquired Pneumonia: The patient
had marked clinical concern upon arrival to the medical floor
because she had hypoxia to 80% on 2L nasal cannula. This
desaturation and shortness of breath was felt to be due to
aspiration event. Patient was transferred to the MICU for
several days of close monitoring. CXR showed LLL opacity.
Bronchoscopy was performed and significant for mucus plugging,
plugging was relieved with improvement of her hypoxia. She was
also treated for hospital aquired pneumonia, and completed a 7
day course of IV vancomycin and a IV ceftazidime. Her
respiratory status has improved to the point where she saturates
in the mid to high 90's on room air, but is more stable in the
mid-90s on 2L NC continuously. She may drop to high 80s without
nasal cannula. Also, with any administration of aggressive IV
fluids, she tends to third spaces/accumulate additional fluid
into her lungs and can desaturate.
#. Clostridium difficile colitis: Patient developed diarrhea
soon after getting several antibiotics for her left
mastitis/cellulitis. Stool studies were positive for Clostridium
difficile. She was treated initially with PO vancomycin and IV
metronidazole with improvement of her symptoms. Antibiotics
were later narrowed to include just PO vancomycin liquid at
125mg q6hrs . She will need to complete another 3 days of PO
vancomycin which is to be completed on [DATE]. PLEASE reassess
if still having diarrhea after completing antibiotics.
#. Thrombocytopenia: During her hospital course the patient was
also noted to be thrombocytopenic and she was evaluated by
heme/oncology service. Several ongoing studies and clinical
trend revealed that she was not thrombocytopenia due to
DIC/TTP/HUS. PF4 antibodies were negative for HIT.
Thrombocytopenia was ultimately attributed to Bactrim. Platelet
count recovered following discontinuation of Bactrim and has

delirium. Divalproex was restarted (sprinkles form at 250mg at
each meal for 750mg daily dose) and most recent level within
normal limits. Risperdal was recommended to be used prn for
agitation but she did not require any risperdal during her
hospital course. Patient may need to be restarted on her usual
pre-admission psychiatric medications that include 15mg
mirtazapine qhs and 50mg trazodone qhs. If possible, please
discuss with psychiatrist while at rehabilitation.
#. Acute renal failure/Oliguria: Despite being anasarcic,
patient was overwhelmingly intravascularly dry. JVP is flat.
She had very poor urine output while in the ICU. Renal labs
showed that she was incredibly prerenal. Her BUN and creatinine
would improve with administration of IVF, however given her poor
nutritional status, it would also cause for her to have more
pulmonary edema and extremity edema. On call out to the floor,
IVF's were very cautiously given during brief periods of
hypernatremia (Na peaked at 148-->143 by discharge), but
otherwise PO intake was encouraged. An albumin challenge was
also tried, but with only marginal increase in her urinary
output. Her urine output has gradually improved over the course
of her stay on the medicine floors, averaging 300-500 cc/day.
U/A consistently showed dirty urine with leuks, WBCs, and few
bacteria. Urine culture at one point showed scant amount of
yeast but otherwise showed no growth. Dirty UA was attributed
to the fact that her urine was so concentrated and she was not
treated for UTI given no new leukocytosis, fevers or other
clinical complaints of suprapubic pain, dysuria or urgency.","70","9","1138","184","0","0","164","21"

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [NAME] [NAME] is a very nice 66 year-old gentleman with
atrial fibrillation on coumadin who comes after a near-syncopal
episode with melena. He was in his prior state of health until 2
months ago when he started feeling fatigued and noticing very
small ammount of blood in his mouth in the mornings that he did
not pay much attention to. He denies any abdominal pain,
epigastric pain, easy bruising or bleeding. Yesterday he states
he did not feel good and that he had 5 loose bowel movements
(not watery) that were normal in color. He woke up in to go to
the bathroom to move his bowels and had [NAME] stools, then on
his way back to the bed he felt dizzy, diaphoretic and fell to
the floor. He did not hit his head or lost consciousness. He dit
not feel confused or exhausted afterwards and there was no aurea
beforehand. He was transfered to the [HOSPITAL] for further
evaluation.
.
In the ER his initial VS were Pain 0/10, T 97.2 F, HR 63 BPM, BP
114/64 mmHg, RR 16 X', SpO2 100% on RA. His initial physical
exam he looked normal. His HCT was 24.3 from baseline of 35 on
[DEIDENTIFIED] according to Atrius Notes and an INR of 2.7. Pt underwent
NG-lavage with brown fluid and after 500cc started to clear to a
pink fluid. However, they started to see [NAME] blood afterwards.
Patient was started on IV pantoprazole gtt, received 4 mg of
zofran for nausea, was T&C and was ordered for 2 RBC Units and 2
units of FFP. He received 3 L of NS. After I discussed with ER
team, they decided to call GI and finally accepted to scope him
tonight in the ICU after elective intubation. Throughout the ER
admission his VS were stable with SBP in 110/70, HR 60 (on
diltiazem) prior to transfer. He has 2 18G for access.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a bleed from an ulcer in your stomach.
This was made worse by the way that Coumadin thins your blood.
Additionally, you developed a pneumonia. You must follow up with
your PCP and complete the antibiotics as prescribed for your
pneumonia. Do not take coumadin until directed by your PCP.
Because of the shape of your stomach, we strongly reccommend
that you get a CT scan of your abdomen
START - Pantoprazole - an acid reducer for your ulcer.
START - Augmentin - an antibiotic
STOP - Coumadin - restart when instructed by your PCP
Followup Instructions:
APPOINTMENT WITH DR. [NAME] - [PHONE] - THURSDAY at 12pm
Please follow up with the gastroenterology team in [DEIDENTIFIED] months.

[DATE] Interventional Radiology:
1. Active bleeding was confirmed angiographically at the hepatic
flexure, best accessed through a middle colic branch coming off
the proximal superior mesenteric artery.
2. Successful embolization of the branch of middle colic artery
with 6 microcoils at the level of marginal artery with good
residual collateral flow at the end of the procedure and
cessation of angiographic extravasation.
[DATE] GI bleeding study
IMPRESSION: Positive GI bleeding study with extravasation of
tracer identifiedwithin the region of the hepatic flexure of the
colon.
[DATE] CXR Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
[DATE] CXR IMPRESSION: Central venous catheter in satisfactory
position. Endotracheal tube also likely satisfactory allowing
for flexed position of the neck.
2. Worsening congestive heart failure with probable asymmetrical
right perihilar pulmonary edema. Superimposed process such as
aspiration in this area cannot be excluded given the presence of
a large hiatal hernia.
[DATE] CXR Right jugular CV line is in mid SVC. There is a
large hiatal hernia as previously demonstrated and probable
atelectases at both lung bases difficult to evaluate in this
single frontal view in the presence of a large hiatal hernia. No
pneumothorax. Surgical clip overlies left superior mediastinum.
Brief Hospital Course:
85F with a h/o afib on coumadin admitted to medicine ICU for
BRBPR. INR on admission was 4.2 and hct had dropped from 36.5
to 28.3 over 2 hours. She was given Vitamin K and tranfused
with 5 units of prbcs and 6 units of FFP. She was taken to IR
where a branch of the middle colic artery was coiled and good
collateral flow identified. GI was also consulted and
recommended colonscopy if pt continued to bleed. Although she
did not exhibit continued profuse bleeding per rectum, serial
hematocrits continued to drop despite transfusion and the
decision to take the patient to the OR for a right hemicolectomy
was made. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the SICU and remained intubated overnight. On POD1, pt was
intubated but could answer questions. She remained in afib with
RVR that did not respond to lopressor and was placed on a
diltiazem infusion. Her BP was closely monitored. She

History of Present Illness:
69 yo woman with h/o CHF, AFIB, ?seizure disorder, recently
discharged from rehab after recent hospitalization for
evaluation of seizure (felt ultimately to be facial tick), was
in USOH until lunch on morning of admission, when upon rising
from a chair, she felt lightheaded/dizzy and slid to the ground.
Her daughter was with her and helped her. No LOC, post-ictal
confusion, incontinence reportedly at the time. After being
helped back into her chair by her daughter, her symptoms
resolved over 5-10 minutes. Her daughter describes a second fall
in the evening, when upon standing to leave, she was again
LH/dizzy, and fell into her daughter who was getting her walker.
ROS notable for poor PO intake x1-2d. She otherwise denies f, c,
ns, ha, cp, sob, palpitation, n/v, abdominal pain, dysuria,
constipation, diarrhea. She has been living with one of her
daughters since d/c from rehab a week ago and was doing well
initially but not eating much recently. Also she has been
supervised some of the time but not all of the time at home. Up
until about [DEIDENTIFIED] she was living independently at home, but
had a fall there and since then has been in the hospital (St
Vincents or Mass [HOSPITAL]) or rehab or with her daughter.

Pertinent Results:
EEG [DATE]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG
recording due to the left PLEDs with a frequency of .[DEIDENTIFIED] Hz. The
slow background and even slower background with a lack of
predominant posterior rhythm on the left. The first abnormality
suggests cortical irritability associated with a
structural abnormality in the left hemisphere. The second
abnormality
suggests a mild encephalopathy and the third abnormality
suggests a
structural subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere. The
excessive beta activity is probably secondary to a medication
effect.
PLEDs are frequently associated with clinical or subclinical
seizures.
If the patient remains lethargic, long-term EEG monitoring may
be of
further diagnostic value in this patient.
.
Echo [DATE]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [DATE], no major change is evident.
.
CT Head [DATE]: IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Asymmetric lateral ventricle size, left slightly larger than
the right, of unknown clinical significance or chronicity
without priors
.
CXR [DATE]: IMPRESSION:

Brief Hospital Course:
69-yo woman with h/o seizure d/o, CVA, recent hospitalization
for facial tics and another recent hospitalization for phenytoin
toxicity, admitted for near-syncope and falls, now s/p seizure
on the floor after stopping phenytoin on admission being
transferred out of the MICU to the floor for continued
observation given.
.
#. Seizure Disorder: Pt had witnessed seizure on the floor in
the setting of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels and being treated
for UTI with ciprofloxacin. The patient has had trouble with
phenytoin clearance, and was discontinued due to
supratherapeutic levels on admission. The patient's Keppra was
continued however. Neurology was consulted and recommended a
phenytoin load and starting phenytoin TID following. NCHCT w/o
acute abnormality for cause of seizure. The patient was also
started on zonisamide. However, the patient developed a fixed
delusion and hallucinations thought to be secondary to this
medication. Zonisamide was discontinued and she was changed
back to phenytoin with close monitoring of her levels.
Ciprofloxacin was changed to bactrim, see below. She had 24
hour EEG monitoring once she was transferred to the floor
without signs of overt seizure. On the regimen of keppra and
phenytoin, the patient did not have any subsequent seizures.
The patient does have right sided arm choreathetoid movements
consistent with the distribution of her previous stroke. It
seems according to Neurology that this movement is exacerbated
when she is agitated, and that she is able to suppress it when
she is not agitated. The patient will follow up with Dr. [NAME]
as an outpatient. She will have phenytoin levels drawn at the
rehab facility and her level changed accordingly.
.
#. UTI: Asymptomatic, however UA showed evidence of UTI and
urine cultures grew both klebsiella and enterococcus. The
patient was initially treated with cipro, then changed to
bactrim given seizure. When the enterococcus was isolated,
amoxicillin was added to the regimen. The patient completed her
course of antibiotics while inpatient. Repeat urine cultures
did not show evidence of persistent infection.
.
# Hallucinations/Delusions: Thought to be secondary to
medication effect from zonisamide. This medication was
discontinued. The patient also had an element of delirium on
transfer from the MICU. All sedating medications including
oxycodone, oxycontin, trazodone, bethanechol were discontinued.
Her delirium resolved, however the fixed delusion remained. The
patient was treated with zyprexa PRN and standing at night. The
patient should continue on zyprexa 5mg at night for the next 4
days to assist with clearing her delusions, then as needed
following.
.
#. Normocytic Anemia: Baseline Hct [YEAR] ~35. Was 35 on
admission, trended down to ~25 in setting of IVF hydration, but
then stabilized. The patient was continued on her home Iron
supplements.
.
#. Urinary retention: Discontinued bethanechol given delirium
as above. Attempted to do voiding trials, however unsucessful.
The patient was transferred with a foley catheter in place. She
may need to follow up with Urology as an outpatient.
.
#. CAD: S/p CABG, unknown anatomy. The patient was continued on
ASA, metoprolol and statin.
.
#. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remained in NSR
during hospitalization. The patient was continued on metoprolol
for rate control. Started coumadin 2mg for anticoagulation.
The patient should have an INR checked on Monday, the results
sent to the on call physician for dose adjustment.
.
#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Last documented echo in [YEAR], showed
EF 55%. Likely secondary to long standing hypertension. The
patient did not have evidence of decompensated heart failure
during her hospitalization. As she does not have signd of
systolic heart failure and was hypovolemic on admission,
diuretics were discontinued and were not restarted prior to
discharge.
.
#. HTN: The patient's blood pressure was well controlled during
her hospitalization. Continued on metoprolol only.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued on home statin
.
#. DM2: Checked FSBS QIDACHS. The patient did not require basal
medications to control, used insulin sliding scale for
hyperglycemia.
.
#. COPD: continued on home combivent inhalers
.
#. OSA: Continued on home BiPAP setting.
.
#. DVT: s/p IVC filter placement. Started on coumadin while
inpatient.
.
#. ARF: The patient was clinically dry on exam on transfer from
the MICU. The ARF resolved with IV fluids, was likely prerenal.
.
#. Constipation: resolved s/p manual disimpation and aggressive
bowel regimen. Restarted bowel regimen once loose stools
resolved.
.
#. FEN: continued on regular, heart healthy, diabetic diet /
replete lytes PRN
#. PPx: SQ Heparin, PPI, bowel regimen

for facial tics and another recent hospitalization for phenytoin
toxicity, admitted for near-syncope and falls, now s/p seizure
on the floor after stopping phenytoin on admission being
transferred out of the MICU to the floor for continued
observation given.
.
#. Seizure Disorder: Pt had witnessed seizure on the floor in
the setting of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels and being treated
for UTI with ciprofloxacin. The patient has had trouble with
phenytoin clearance, and was discontinued due to
supratherapeutic levels on admission. The patient's Keppra was
continued however. Neurology was consulted and recommended a
phenytoin load and starting phenytoin TID following. NCHCT w/o
acute abnormality for cause of seizure. The patient was also
started on zonisamide. However, the patient developed a fixed
delusion and hallucinations thought to be secondary to this
medication. Zonisamide was discontinued and she was changed
back to phenytoin with close monitoring of her levels.
Ciprofloxacin was changed to bactrim, see below. She had 24
hour EEG monitoring once she was transferred to the floor
without signs of overt seizure. On the regimen of keppra and
phenytoin, the patient did not have any subsequent seizures.
The patient does have right sided arm choreathetoid movements
consistent with the distribution of her previous stroke. It
seems according to Neurology that this movement is exacerbated
when she is agitated, and that she is able to suppress it when
she is not agitated. The patient will follow up with Dr. [NAME]
as an outpatient. She will have phenytoin levels drawn at the
rehab facility and her level changed accordingly.
.
#. UTI: Asymptomatic, however UA showed evidence of UTI and
urine cultures grew both klebsiella and enterococcus. The
patient was initially treated with cipro, then changed to
bactrim given seizure. When the enterococcus was isolated,
amoxicillin was added to the regimen. The patient completed her
course of antibiotics while inpatient. Repeat urine cultures
did not show evidence of persistent infection.
.
# Hallucinations/Delusions: Thought to be secondary to
medication effect from zonisamide. This medication was
discontinued. The patient also had an element of delirium on
transfer from the MICU. All sedating medications including
oxycodone, oxycontin, trazodone, bethanechol were discontinued.
Her delirium resolved, however the fixed delusion remained. The
patient was treated with zyprexa PRN and standing at night. The
patient should continue on zyprexa 5mg at night for the next 4
days to assist with clearing her delusions, then as needed
following.
.
#. Normocytic Anemia: Baseline Hct [YEAR] ~35. Was 35 on
admission, trended down to ~25 in setting of IVF hydration, but
then stabilized. The patient was continued on her home Iron
supplements.
.
#. Urinary retention: Discontinued bethanechol given delirium
as above. Attempted to do voiding trials, however unsucessful.
The patient was transferred with a foley catheter in place. She
may need to follow up with Urology as an outpatient.
.
#. CAD: S/p CABG, unknown anatomy. The patient was continued on
ASA, metoprolol and statin.
.
#. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remained in NSR
during hospitalization. The patient was continued on metoprolol
for rate control. Started coumadin 2mg for anticoagulation.
The patient should have an INR checked on Monday, the results
sent to the on call physician for dose adjustment.
.
#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Last documented echo in [YEAR], showed
EF 55%. Likely secondary to long standing hypertension. The
patient did not have evidence of decompensated heart failure
during her hospitalization. As she does not have signd of
systolic heart failure and was hypovolemic on admission,
diuretics were discontinued and were not restarted prior to
discharge.
.
#. HTN: The patient's blood pressure was well controlled during
her hospitalization. Continued on metoprolol only.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued on home statin
.
#. DM2: Checked FSBS QIDACHS. The patient did not require basal
medications to control, used insulin sliding scale for
hyperglycemia.

#. DVT: s/p IVC filter placement. Started on coumadin while
inpatient.

bowel regimen. Restarted bowel regimen once loose stools
resolved.

Pertinent Results:
MRI Head [DEIDENTIFIED]
 Surgical planning study showing an extra-axial mass, which
homogeneously enhances in the area of the right temporal lobe.
This mass is consistent with a meningioma.
CT Head [DEIDENTIFIED] Post op
Status post resection of right frontal meningioma with
postoperative pneumocephalus and small amount of hemorrhage.
There is
resulting edema with effacement of the right suprasellar
cistern, which could indicate an impending uncal herniation
CXR [DATE]
The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Lung volumes are low with
crowding at the bases. There is mild pulmonary vascular
redistribution.
There is probable small left pleural effusion that is new
compared to the
prior study.
EEG [DATE]
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because
of continuous focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies,
frequent
epileptiform discharges in the right centroparietal region, and
frequent
electrographic seizures over the right frontotemporal region.
These
findings are indicative of an epileptogenic focal structural
lesion in
the right hemisphere, giving rise to frequent (58) right
frontotemporal
electrographic seizures. In addition, there is diffuse
background
slowing and slow alpha rhythm, indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Compared to
the prior
day's recording, electrographic seizures have increased in
frequency,
but the background activity is unchanged.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [DATE]
New hypodensity in the right MCA territory. This change is most
likely ischemic, less likely post-surgical.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [DATE]
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [DATE] : IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right MCA territory infarct with mild internal
hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged bilateral occipital [DOCTOR] intraventricular
hemorrhages.
MRI Head [DATE]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large subacute infarct in the right frontal and temporal
lobes.
2. Postoperative changes of the right frontal and temporal skull
and scalp.
3. Stable small amount of intraventricular blood in the
posterior horns of
the lateral ventricles.
4. No evidence of herniation or obstructive hydrocephalus.
5. Small 1- to 2-mm outpouchings along the distal aspect of the
M1 segment of the right MCA, possible infundibular dilatation of
normal branch vessles or true aneurysms. Findings are similar
compared to prior outside hospital MRA. Further
characterization with CTA is recommended or possibly direct
angiography if clinically indicated.
CXR: [DATE]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right internal jugular central line with its tip in the
superior vena cava unchanged. Endotracheal tube now has its tip
approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen
coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
2. Persistent relatively low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar
opacities
most likely reflecting patchy atelectasis though an infectious
process cannot be entirely excluded. No pleural effusions or
pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax although evaluation is
limited as the patient is likely supine on the current
examination. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with
calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
CXR portable [DEIDENTIFIED]
1. Mild improvement in the degree of pulmonary vascular
distention.
2. No evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
CXR portable [DEIDENTIFIED] for line placement:
Repositioned right PICC terminating at the superior cavoatrial
junction.
CXR portalbe [DEIDENTIFIED]: improved left basilar atelectasis, stable
rightsided atelectasis
CXR portable [DEIDENTIFIED]: stable appearance of lungs compared with
prior xray
CXR Portable [DEIDENTIFIED]:SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST: A nasogastric tube
again passes into the stomach and off the inferior margin of the
film. Right PICC extends to the cavoatrial junction, possibly
into the upper right atrium. The lungs are unchanged in
appearance with persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar
atelectasis. No new opacity to suggest pneumonia. No
pneumothorax or large effusion. There is bronchovascular
crowding and mild vascular congestion without convincing
evidence of pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from one day prior.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [DATE] 1:37 PM FINDINGS:
There is persistent hypodensity in the right operculum,
consistent
with evolution of infarct in the right MCA territory. There is
less
conspicuous involvement of the right temporal lobe. There is no
shift of
midline structures. A small amount of dependent layering blood
in the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricle is unchanged from NECT
of the head on [DATE]. There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent
with age-related atrophy. Postsurgical changes from right
frontoparietal craniotomy are again noted. Pneumocephalus noted
on prior NECT of the head is resolved. The left sphenoid sinus
is almost completely opacified. The mastoid air cells and middle
ear cavities are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving right MCA infarct. No evidence of mass effect.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [DEIDENTIFIED] The tip of the nasogastric tube and side port are
below the gastroesophageal junction appropriately sited. There
is again seen cardiomegaly. There is some atelectasis at the
left lung base. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal
lead tip at the upper right atrium. There are no pneumothoraces
or pleural effusions.
LENIs [DEIDENTIFIED] - negative for DVT
CXR [DATE]
1. There is no pneumothorax.
2. Left lower lung atelectasis has worsened since [DATE].
3. Pneumoperitoneum, most likely related to recent PEG, as
suggested from the clinical history.
11/17 L foot x ray
1. No evidence of fracture or dislocation
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [NAME] was admitted to Neurosurgery on [DATE] and
underwent a right frontal craniotomy for tumor resection.
Please review dictated operative report for details. Patient
was extubated without incident and remained in the ICU for close
monitoring. He apeared to be a bit lethargic on exam on post
operative day one and per nursing report he was intermitantly
not moving his left arm which could be consistant with
subclinical seizures. An EEG was ordered along with a keppra
750mg bolus and his daily dose was increased to 1000mg [HOSPITAL]. Over
the weekend of [DATE] he continued to have focal seizures and
his daily dose was again increased to 1250mg [HOSPITAL]. He had a
speech and swallow exam on [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was not cleared for a PO
diet. His DHT remained in and he was kept on tube feeds. He was
transferred to the floor with 24 hour EEG monitoring. His diet
[NAME] advance to puree/nectar thick after Swallow exam on [DEIDENTIFIED].
EEG was negative for seizure activity for 24 hours and the leads
were discontinuued. He was seen by PT/OT and required rehab.
Overnight 11/2-3 he was agitated and needed restraints. He was
lethargic in the am but was oriented to all but month. In late
afternoon he was only arousable to sternal rub. CT head showed a
right sided stroke and he was transfered to the ICU. Stroke
Neurology was consulted. A carotid US was ordered. ASA and
Plavix was restarted. Overnight, patient was intubated for
airway protection and lethargy.
On [DEIDENTIFIED], on examination, patient had no EO, followed simple
commands and MAE R>L. MRI head and stroke workup pending. Repeat
head CT performed overnight for increased lethargy showed stable
stoke. EEG was negative for seizure activity.
On [DEIDENTIFIED] the patient's neurological exam was improving. neurology
felt the the stroke was post operative in nature and not do to
an embolic source. Echo was negative and carotid u/s revealed
60-65% stenosis in Right ICA. He was given 2 units or PRBC's
for a dropping Hct.
He failed trial of extubation. He was extubated and became
stridorous and required reintubation. He was bradycardic to the
40's so his beta blockade was discontinued. His decadron was
weaned on [DEIDENTIFIED]. Patient's keppra was decreased from 1250 to
1000mg [HOSPITAL] and EEG over the weekend were negative for seizure
activity.
On [DEIDENTIFIED], patient was placed on CPAP and subsequently weaned to
extubate. His exam was stable with EO to noxious stimuli and
following commands in all 4 extremities.
On [DEIDENTIFIED] a speech and swallow exam was attempted however the
patient was too lethargic to fully cooperate and so it was
defered. On [DEIDENTIFIED] he was lethargic and CT showed evolving CVA
.He remained in the unit. PT and OT were consulted for
assistance with discharge planning.A chest xray was performed
which was consistent no new relevant changes in the lungs. Lung
volumes are low. Minimal bibasal atelectasis is unchanged. There
are no new lung opacities of concern. Top normal heart size,
mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.
On [DEIDENTIFIED], A Head CT was performed due to lethargy which was
consistent with evolving right MCA infarct, no evidence of mass
effect or intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient stayed in the Intensive Care Unit for lethragy and
inability to clear respiratory secretions. A chest Xray was
performed which was stable.
On [DEIDENTIFIED], the patient failed his Speech and Swallow. He was
unable to transfer out of the ICU today due to increase
respiratory secretions.
On [DEIDENTIFIED] he was transferred to Stepdown Unit in stable

On [DEIDENTIFIED], On exam, the patient was intermittently lethargic. He
was oriented to self and hospital.The patient opens eyes
intermittently. The patient followed commands in all 4
extremities, he moves the left side less. The left leg was
spastic. The craniotomy incision staples were closed.
On [DEIDENTIFIED], Bilateral Lower Extremity ultrasound was Negative. The
patient failed her Speech Swallow test. The ACS service was
consulted for placement of a Gastric Tube.
On [NAME]. ASA/Plavix were
not held due to his recent CVA. The the risks and benfits of
this were discussed with his wife. [NAME] had this done on [DEIDENTIFIED]. He
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the [HOSPITAL] 11 floor.
At 4pm he had 55 cc of bright red blood and lcot suctioned from
his mouth but there was no sign of acute bleeding. ACS was
called and a STAT HCt was sent, this was 31.3 then 30.8. The
next day he was without further bleeding from the mouth. He was
more awake and communicative and did well with PT on [DEIDENTIFIED]. CXR
ruled out pneumothroax with some mild pneumoperitoneum from his
procedure. His tube feeds continued. Heparin was restarted.
Rehab screening was in place. He had some left foot pain and
X-ray showed no fracture or dislocation. He was tolerating his
tube feeds per GT without difficulty.He was transferred to rehab

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 52 year old male who
presents now with a three day history of nausea, vomiting,
fever and chills. Reports that the pain started three days
prior which was sharp pain, crampy in nature, that was
periumbilical but did radiate to his back. He reports a
similar history of pain about a month ago which was less
severe and managed by his primary care physician who found
some transiently elevated liver function tests. He reports
that he is still passing gas. His last bowel movement was
yesterday but has noticed decreased P.O. intake with some
nausea and emesis.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA: White count of 26.5, his lipase
was 1701. Chem-7 was normal. An ultrasound showed
cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall thickening and edema
consistent with acute cholecystitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Gold Surgery
Service, was given aggressive intravenous hydration, Foley
placed, was empirically started on levothyroxine, ampicillin
and Flagyl with bowel rest, remaining n.p.o. and endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Consultants were called
to help assist with what appears to be gallstone
pancreatitis. On hospital day one the patient did well
overnight but did continue to have mid epigastric pain which
was tender on palpation. His liver function tests were
amylase 1214, lipase 1701. Patient underwent an MRCP to
evaluate the bowel ducts and common bile duct stones which
showed an acute pancreatitis with non-loculated fluid
collections extending around the pancreatic tail and left
anterior parenchymal space, large gallstone with some
increased signal in the wall concerning for possible
hemorrhagic cholecystitis. No choledocholithiasis. The
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring because of a history of confusion and
disorientation. The patient responded appropriately over the
next one to two days and was transferred from Intensive Care
Unit to the floor. Patient was continued on ampicillin,
Levaquin and Flagyl on [DEIDENTIFIED]. Patient remained in
Intensive Care Unit due to lack of beds but was on floor
status, had a low grade temperature of 100.6, was started on
clears, had good urine output. On hospital day six the
patient was continued on just Levaquin and Flagyl and was
tolerating some P.O. However, began to have an increase in
tenderness in his mid-epigastric region and increased
abdominal pain. The patient remained n.p.o. and plan was for
laparoscopic cholecystectomy in approximately three to four
days. PICC line was placed. Total parenteral nutrition was
started. On [DEIDENTIFIED] patient had a temperature of 102.2,
was pancultured, continued on total parenteral nutrition. On
hospital day 11, [DATE] patient underwent a
laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative
cholangiogram and a primary umbilical hernia repair. Patient
was transferred to the floor postoperatively and had an
unremarkable postoperative course and advanced from n.p.o. to
clears to full diet without abdominal pain or nausea or
vomiting. Total parenteral nutrition was halved and then
stopped. Patient was discharged in good condition to home.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative
 cholangiogram on [DATE].
2. History of obstructive sleep apnea and uses CPAP at home.
3. Depression.
4. Hypothyroidism.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lamotrigine 100 mg P.O. q day,
albuterol and Atrovent, Percocet 5/325 1 to 2 tablets P.O. q
4 to 6 hours, dispense 60, beta blocker metoprolol 25 mg P.O.
q day, levothyroxine 25 mcg P.O. q day and Colace 100 mg P.O.

 She has a recent history of having an occluded LUE AV [HOSPITAL],
requiring thrombectomy and stent placement on [DATE]. Patient
had unremarkable HD session on Wednesday [DEIDENTIFIED], then developed
some arm pain on [DEIDENTIFIED] in the evening; this was attributed to
fatigue after having done arm exercises earlier in the day. On
the morning of admission, the patient also experienced transient
nausea. She denies any other symptoms. Diaylsis session today
could not even be started, and patient was sent to ED for
evaluation. In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 72 110/p 18 97%.
Exam was notable for absence of thrill over [DEIDENTIFIED], a ""cordlike
AVG"" and bibasilar crackles. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated
100% fistula occlusion for 2-3 cm with no Doppler flow. Labs
were notable for creatinine elevated to 5.4, and INR 1.8.
Transplant surgery was consulted, and recommended admission to
medicine with plan to have IR perform thrombectomy. IR will do
thrombectomy tomorrow, after NPO tonight.

LEFT AV [DEIDENTIFIED] ULTRASOUND: Targeted evaluation of the antecubital
fossa reveals a completely occluded Dacron [DEIDENTIFIED], with no
detectable internal flow. The venous outflow limb, likely the
cephalic vein, is also nearly occluded by acute expansile and
heterogeneous thrombus, with minimal areas of residual flow. The
left subclavian and axillary veins are patent with normal
waveforms. The arterial inflow to the [DEIDENTIFIED] (brachial artery)
is widely patent, and demonstrates normal Doppler waveforms.
There is moderate overlying subcutaneous edema.

FINDINGS:
1. Complete thrombosis of the left arm AV [DEIDENTIFIED]. Flow was noted
in the arterial inflow on son[NAME].
2. Near-complete thrombosis of the left arm venous outflow
tract. Of note,
was the extravasation of contrast from the [NAME] adjacent to its
venous outflow anastomosis, presumably resulting from prior
[NAME] access. Further
attempts at AV [NAME] declot were abandoned.
IMPRESSION:
1. Uncomplicated AV [NAME]-gram. Unsuccessful attempt at
declotting.
Fluoroscopy and son[NAME] used for guidance.
2. Uncomplicated placement of a 12 French 20-cm temporary
hemodialysis catheter with VIP port via the patent left IJV and
with its tip in the lower SVC, under fluoroscopic and
son[NAME] guidance.

Mid-cavitary gradient. No VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. Mod functional MS due to MAC. Mild
to moderate ([DEIDENTIFIED]+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Mild [1+] TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A
mid-cavitary gradient is identified. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. There is moderate functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 11 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild to moderate ([DEIDENTIFIED]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [DEIDENTIFIED]/201, LV
systolic function is now hyperdynamic.
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [NAME] is 83 year old with HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV CKD
(HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple admissions for CHF
exacerbation, and recent admission for afib with RVR during
dialysis, who was admitted from [HOSPITAL] clinic after failed dialysis,
and was found to have a thrombosed AV [HOSPITAL].
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Thrombosed AV [HOSPITAL]: Prior to admission, patient developed
left arm pain, and was found to have non-functioning [HOSPITAL] at
outpatient hemodialysis. Complete thrombosis of her AV [HOSPITAL]
was demonstrated on ultrasound in Emergency Department. She was
admitted for thrombectomy for reinitiation of dialysis, although
there was no emergent need for dialysis. Thrombosis was likely
due to foreign material of [HOSPITAL] (vs. fistula, which has lower
likelihood of thrombosis). On [DEIDENTIFIED], Interventional Radiology
attempted a thrombectomy, but were unable to clear the [DEIDENTIFIED];
they placed a left internal jugular tunnelled catheter, which
did not function in dialysis later that day. Patient had an
abbreviated dialysis session via that tunnelled catheter on
[DEIDENTIFIED]. On [DEIDENTIFIED], Interventional Radiology again attempted
thrombectomy and were successful. The following day, the
patient restarted HD via her [DEIDENTIFIED]. Her tunnelled catheter was
then removed.
.
# Hypotension: Patient with a history of hypotension during
dialysis sessions and her family endorses that her baseline
blood pressure at [NAME] eis 90s/40s. At the start of HD on [DEIDENTIFIED],
one day s/p thrombectomy and replacement of her tunnelled line,
patient was hypotensive to systolics in the 70s. This was in
the context of having been NPO for much of the days preceding
this session. During HD, she was persistently hypotensive, but
had some response to IV boluses of NS. On returning to the
floor, her BP was 90/60 but dropped again to 64/dopp. All the
while, patient was mentating well, only complaining of a
headache and new right lower quadrant pain. In the context of
recent instrumentation, sepsis from a [DEIDENTIFIED] site infection vs.
tunnelled line was of high suspition; this accompanied new onset
of a left shift with 87% PMNs. However, she did not have an
elevated lactate and did not develop fevers or redness at the
dialysis sites. Her antihyptertensives were discontinued.
Blood cultures had been sent from dialysis but are no growth to
date.
 She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring of
her blood pressure. She continued to have blood pressures
80s-90s/40s and with good mentation. Infectious work-up
including cultures and chest x-ray were negative. There was no
clear infectious etiology for her hypotension and her
antibiotics were discontinue. Her volume status and blood
pressure continued to elude firm control for several days. On
[DEIDENTIFIED] she became tachycardic secodnary to betablocker
withdrawl and anxiety and flashed. She underwent bedside
ultrafultration however her blood pressures during the session
were too loow to accomodate any agressive fluid removal. She
improved with rate control. Cardiology was consulted and an
echocardiogram showed EF of 75% as well as mild Mitral stenosis
and LVOT gradient. It was decided that her LVOT gradient
worsened with tachycardia leading to hypotension (much in the
same way as HOCM patients) There was some discussion regarding
adding back some volume in addtion to pursuing rate control
however after discussin with primary team, cardiology and
nephrology a compromise was reached where she will remain on low
to medium dose betablockers and received 5mg of midodrine prior
to HD to increase SVR and overcome the LVOT gradient. This was
trialed on day prior to dischanrge and she tolerated the new
regimen well with stable blood pressures in the 110-120 systolic
ranges.
.
.
# Anticoagulation: Patient had been on oral anticoagulation with
warfarin for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was
diagnosed in 11/[YEAR]. Upon admission, her warfarin was held for
procedures, and restarted on [DATE]. She will need continue
uptitration of her warfarin for goal INR [DEIDENTIFIED] for CHADS of 3.
.
# ESRD/CKD V: Patient has been dialysis-dependent since [DEIDENTIFIED]
[YEAR], but still makes some urine. Prior to admission on [DEIDENTIFIED],
the patient's last hemodialysis session had been [DEIDENTIFIED]. Based
on her labs and overall clinical picture, there was no emergent
need for dialysis. After placement of a right IJ tunneled cath
on [DEIDENTIFIED], she was able to undergo an abbreviated HD session on
[DEIDENTIFIED]. The patient continued her home nephrocaps and
sevelamer throughout hospitalization. Her diet included a 2g
phosphorus restriction. She will continue MWF HD with5 mg
midodrine given prior to each treatment.
.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Anemia: Baseline Hgb 11.5, likely secondary to ESRD. Patient
receives weekly Epogen. Blood counts were stable during this
admission.
.
# CHF, chronic diastolic: Diastolic, chronic with mild LVH, EF
60-65% in 3/[YEAR]. Patient was monitored with daily weights, and
strict in's and out's. There were no signs of volume overload.
Her goal daily balance was net even. She was continued on her
home beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
.
# HTN: Well-controlled on home medications, which were
continued.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Paroxysmal, diagnosed in [DATE].
Patient was monitored on telemetry, and continued on her home
metoprolol and amiodarone. Warfarin was held, as discussed
above.
.
# HLD: Continued on home Lipitor.
.
# Depression: Well-controlled on home venlafaxine.
.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Anticoagulation: Patient should have her INR checked daily.
Based on that level, her warfarin should be adjusted for a goal
INR 2.0-3.0 for her atrial fibrillation.
# Patient to receive 5mg midodrine MWF 30 min prior to HD
# If patient begins the flass first control heart rate than
assess volume status.

requiring thrombectomy and stent placement on [DATE]. Patient
had unremarkable HD session on Wednesday [DEIDENTIFIED], then developed
some arm pain on [DEIDENTIFIED] in the evening; this was attributed to
fatigue after having done arm exercises earlier in the day. On
the morning of admission, the patient also experienced transient
nausea. She denies any other symptoms. Diaylsis session today
could not even be started, and patient was sent to ED for
evaluation. In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 72 110/p 18 97%.
Exam was notable for absence of thrill over [DEIDENTIFIED], a ""cordlike
AVG"" and bibasilar crackles. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated
100% fistula occlusion for 2-3 cm with no Doppler flow. Labs
were notable for creatinine elevated to 5.4, and INR 1.8.
Transplant surgery was consulted, and recommended admission to
medicine with plan to have IR perform thrombectomy. IR will do
thrombectomy tomorrow, after NPO tonight.

(HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple admissions for CHF
exacerbation, and recent admission for afib with RVR during
dialysis, who was admitted from [HOSPITAL] clinic after failed dialysis,
and was found to have a thrombosed AV [HOSPITAL].
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Thrombosed AV [HOSPITAL]: Prior to admission, patient developed
left arm pain, and was found to have non-functioning [HOSPITAL] at
outpatient hemodialysis. Complete thrombosis of her AV [HOSPITAL]
was demonstrated on ultrasound in Emergency Department. She was
admitted for thrombectomy for reinitiation of dialysis, although
there was no emergent need for dialysis. Thrombosis was likely
due to foreign material of [HOSPITAL] (vs. fistula, which has lower
likelihood of thrombosis). On [DEIDENTIFIED], Interventional Radiology
attempted a thrombectomy, but were unable to clear the [DEIDENTIFIED];
they placed a left internal jugular tunnelled catheter, which
did not function in dialysis later that day. Patient had an
abbreviated dialysis session via that tunnelled catheter on
[DEIDENTIFIED]. On [DEIDENTIFIED], Interventional Radiology again attempted
thrombectomy and were successful. The following day, the
patient restarted HD via her [DEIDENTIFIED]. Her tunnelled catheter was
then removed.
.
# Hypotension: Patient with a history of hypotension during
dialysis sessions and her family endorses that her baseline
blood pressure at [NAME] eis 90s/40s. At the start of HD on [DEIDENTIFIED],
one day s/p thrombectomy and replacement of her tunnelled line,
patient was hypotensive to systolics in the 70s. This was in
the context of having been NPO for much of the days preceding
this session. During HD, she was persistently hypotensive, but
had some response to IV boluses of NS. On returning to the
floor, her BP was 90/60 but dropped again to 64/dopp. All the
while, patient was mentating well, only complaining of a
headache and new right lower quadrant pain. In the context of
recent instrumentation, sepsis from a [DEIDENTIFIED] site infection vs.
tunnelled line was of high suspition; this accompanied new onset
of a left shift with 87% PMNs. However, she did not have an
elevated lactate and did not develop fevers or redness at the
dialysis sites. Her antihyptertensives were discontinued.
Blood cultures had been sent from dialysis but are no growth to
date.
 She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring of
her blood pressure. She continued to have blood pressures
80s-90s/40s and with good mentation. Infectious work-up
including cultures and chest x-ray were negative. There was no
clear infectious etiology for her hypotension and her
antibiotics were discontinue. Her volume status and blood
pressure continued to elude firm control for several days. On
[DEIDENTIFIED] she became tachycardic secodnary to betablocker
withdrawl and anxiety and flashed. She underwent bedside
ultrafultration however her blood pressures during the session
were too loow to accomodate any agressive fluid removal. She
improved with rate control. Cardiology was consulted and an
echocardiogram showed EF of 75% as well as mild Mitral stenosis
and LVOT gradient. It was decided that her LVOT gradient
worsened with tachycardia leading to hypotension (much in the
same way as HOCM patients) There was some discussion regarding
adding back some volume in addtion to pursuing rate control
however after discussin with primary team, cardiology and
nephrology a compromise was reached where she will remain on low
to medium dose betablockers and received 5mg of midodrine prior
to HD to increase SVR and overcome the LVOT gradient. This was
trialed on day prior to dischanrge and she tolerated the new
regimen well with stable blood pressures in the 110-120 systolic
ranges.
.
.
# Anticoagulation: Patient had been on oral anticoagulation with
warfarin for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was
diagnosed in 11/[YEAR]. Upon admission, her warfarin was held for
procedures, and restarted on [DATE]. She will need continue
uptitration of her warfarin for goal INR [DEIDENTIFIED] for CHADS of 3.
.
# ESRD/CKD V: Patient has been dialysis-dependent since [DEIDENTIFIED]
[YEAR], but still makes some urine. Prior to admission on [DEIDENTIFIED],
the patient's last hemodialysis session had been [DEIDENTIFIED]. Based
on her labs and overall clinical picture, there was no emergent
need for dialysis. After placement of a right IJ tunneled cath
on [DEIDENTIFIED], she was able to undergo an abbreviated HD session on
[DEIDENTIFIED]. The patient continued her home nephrocaps and
sevelamer throughout hospitalization. Her diet included a 2g
phosphorus restriction. She will continue MWF HD with5 mg
midodrine given prior to each treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI hemorrhage- The
patient was admitted for melena, likely secondary to an upper GI
bleed. She received a total of 2 U PRBCs upon admission with
Lasix following the transfusion. She was started on Protonix IV
bid on admission. An abdominal u/s in the ED demonstrated a
patent TIPS. Her hematocrit remained stable overnight and she
was planned for endoscopy the following morning. She was quite
encephalopathic upon admission and refused to take any of her
medications, including lactulose and rifaximin. Due to the
encephalopathy and mental status, the patient was electively
intubated prior to the EGD on [DATE], without any
complications. An EGD on [DATE] showed portal gastropathy only
without any evidence of active bleeding. There was no evidence
of varices. She was extubated successfully the following day on
[DATE] and her respiratory status has been stable since on room
air. Since her EGD she was without further episodes of BRBPR or
melena. Her HCT was slowly downward trending and on [DATE]
she received one additional unit 1u PRBC with an appropriate HCT
increase to 28.9. Haptoglobin was also checked and found to be
<20, consistent with either slight hemolysis or could be
attributed to underlying liver disease. Otherwise, most likely
has subacute bleeding as a chronic issue secondary to
gastropathy or hemorrhoids. Upon discharge, was sent to an
extended care facility with instruction to transfuse for any HCT
less than 25, and to check a CBC every other day.
# HCV Cirrhosis with AMS - Known to have h/o hepatic
encephalopathy, was not tolerating lactulose/rifaximin so NGT
was placed. Given lactulose with improvement. She later
self-discontinued the NGT and subsequently tolerated oral
medications. She was continued on rifaximin & lactulose and her
mental status returned to baseline. Was also restarted on low
dose Lasix and Aldactone, which she tolerated well prior to
discharge.
# Hypernatrema - Thought to be [DEIDENTIFIED] decreased oral intake and
dehydration. Initially she was corrected with free water
boluses with her tube feeds. After removal of the NGT, she was
given IV D5W for correction given that she was unable to take in
enough oral hydration to correct it herself. Over several days,
she was slowly corrected and the day of discharge had a sodium
level of 140. Upon discharge, instructions were given to her
extended care facility for monitoring or her sodium levels, as
well as instructions for correction based on the current level.
# Acute renal failure with Chronic Renal Insufficiency -
Creatinine at recent baseline (1.7-2.0), and admitted with
creatinine 1.9. Unclear etiology, but originally thought to be
likely secondary to end stage liver disease. Increased BUN may
be secondary to GI Bleed. Also may be elevated from baseline
given free water deficit. Later improved to baseline after
treatment of free water deficits. Upon discharge, his
creatinine was 1.3. Extended care facility given instruction to
monitor creatinine and dose diuretics appropriately.
# COPD - Admitted at baseline without evidence of acute flair,
and clear pulmonary exam. Was intubated due to AMS, but was
later successfully extubated, as described above. The morning
of [DEIDENTIFIED], had acute onset wheezing, thought to be most likely
due to volume overload in the setting of increased free water
rather than acute flair. Was treated with IV Lasix and
albuterol nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Once fluid
repletion was done more gently and home diuretics were
restarted, she had no further episodes of dyspnea.

s/p EGD [DATE], blood transfusion","1","This is a 62 y/o female with PMH significant for HCV/ESLD, h/o
GIB, recently admitted from [DEIDENTIFIED] for a signficant LGIB
s/p TIPS, p/w black stools, lethargy, and confusion. Pt noted to
have a HCT of 18 and was transfused 2 Units PRBC's at 0530 on
[DEIDENTIFIED].
Most recent hospitilization was c/b respiratory failure [DEIDENTIFIED]
pulmonary edema and nosocomial PNA, she was intubated for 10
days and completed a course of antibiotics for 12 days as well
as diuresis with lasix. Her LGIB was thought to be [DEIDENTIFIED] rectal
hemorrhoids and required [NAME] [NAME] at some point during her
course. She was discharged to rehab on [DEIDENTIFIED] in stable condition
with a Hct of 30.
In the ED, initial VS were T 97.4, 68, 99/60, 14, 100% RA. An
abdominal u/s was performed and demonstrated a patent TIPS. Head
CT revealed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect. HCT was 24.4. Foley with 400 cc of UO.
She was given vitamin K 10 Units SC, 40 mg IV protonix,
lactulose 30 ml, and 2 U FFP. The hepatology service was made
aware and plan to scope her tomorrow. She was admitted to the
MICU for further management.
Upon admit she is encephalopathic and moaning. Unable to obtain
history.","1","1. Acute blood loss anemia secondary to GI hemorrhage- The
patient was admitted for melena, likely secondary to an upper GI
bleed. She received a total of 2 U PRBCs upon admission with
Lasix following the transfusion. She was started on Protonix IV
bid on admission. An abdominal u/s in the ED demonstrated a
patent TIPS. Her hematocrit remained stable overnight and she
was planned for endoscopy the following morning. She was quite
encephalopathic upon admission and refused to take any of her
medications, including lactulose and rifaximin. Due to the
encephalopathy and mental status, the patient was electively
intubated prior to the EGD on [DATE], without any
complications. An EGD on [DATE] showed portal gastropathy only
without any evidence of active bleeding. There was no evidence
of varices. She was extubated successfully the following day on
[DATE] and her respiratory status has been stable since on room
air. Since her EGD she was without further episodes of BRBPR or
melena. Her HCT was slowly downward trending and on [DATE]
she received one additional unit 1u PRBC with an appropriate HCT
increase to 28.9. Haptoglobin was also checked and found to be
<20, consistent with either slight hemolysis or could be
attributed to underlying liver disease. Otherwise, most likely
has subacute bleeding as a chronic issue secondary to
gastropathy or hemorrhoids. Upon discharge, was sent to an
extended care facility with instruction to transfuse for any HCT
less than 25, and to check a CBC every other day.
# HCV Cirrhosis with AMS - Known to have h/o hepatic
encephalopathy, was not tolerating lactulose/rifaximin so NGT
was placed. Given lactulose with improvement. She later
self-discontinued the NGT and subsequently tolerated oral
medications. She was continued on rifaximin & lactulose and her
mental status returned to baseline. Was also restarted on low
dose Lasix and Aldactone, which she tolerated well prior to
discharge.
# Hypernatrema - Thought to be [DEIDENTIFIED] decreased oral intake and
dehydration. Initially she was corrected with free water
boluses with her tube feeds. After removal of the NGT, she was
given IV D5W for correction given that she was unable to take in
enough oral hydration to correct it herself. Over several days,
she was slowly corrected and the day of discharge had a sodium
level of 140. Upon discharge, instructions were given to her
extended care facility for monitoring or her sodium levels, as
well as instructions for correction based on the current level.
# Acute renal failure with Chronic Renal Insufficiency -
Creatinine at recent baseline (1.7-2.0), and admitted with
creatinine 1.9. Unclear etiology, but originally thought to be
likely secondary to end stage liver disease. Increased BUN may
be secondary to GI Bleed. Also may be elevated from baseline
given free water deficit. Later improved to baseline after
treatment of free water deficits. Upon discharge, his
creatinine was 1.3. Extended care facility given instruction to
monitor creatinine and dose diuretics appropriately.
# COPD - Admitted at baseline without evidence of acute flair,
and clear pulmonary exam. Was intubated due to AMS, but was
later successfully extubated, as described above. The morning
of [DEIDENTIFIED], had acute onset wheezing, thought to be most likely
due to volume overload in the setting of increased free water
rather than acute flair. Was treated with IV Lasix and
albuterol nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Once fluid
repletion was done more gently and home diuretics were
restarted, she had no further episodes of dyspnea.","1","1) iron deficiency anemia

-PICC line placed on [DATE].
History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84 year old female with a past medical history of
hypertesnion, hypercholesterolemia, prior CVAs, previous upper
GI bleeds, who lives at a nursing home and was brought to the ED
on [DATE] by EMS following a large amount of coffee ground
emesis in the morning on [DATE]. In the ED, patient sustained
another episode of dark emesis. She was intubated for airway
protection without difficulty and emesis was noted in the
trachea. She remained hemodynamically stable, although she was
tachycardic. She received 4L of normal saline, levofloxacin and
clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia. After two more units of
packed red [DEIDENTIFIED] cells, she was admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
Of note, patient's son reports that she had a prior episode of
and upper GI bleed several years ago. A workup at that time,
including EGD was reportedly negative. She was placed on a daily
PPI. A follow up EGD approximately one month ago was also
reportedly negative, though her PPI dose was increased to Nexium
40 [HOSPITAL].
.
She was recently discharged from [HOSPITAL] at end of [DATE]
after falling and sustaining C1 fracture that was managed
conservatively with a cervical collar.
.
Patient was transferred from the ED to MICU Green. K has been
labile 2.9 to 5.1 during admission, initially 4.0. EGD did not
show source of GI bleed, but [DEIDENTIFIED] was seen in the stomach. In
the MICU, Hct was stable at 28-29, and she was hemodynamically
stable for her two days in MICU. On transfer out of MICU, BP
114/58, HR 68. UA negative, CXR shows bibasilar opacities
possibly from aspiration and L pleural effusion. [DEIDENTIFIED] [DEIDENTIFIED]
cultures were positive for coag neg Staph.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGES:
-Head CT without contrast ([DATE]): No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
-Cardiac TTE ([DATE]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetation seen. If clinically
indicated, a TEE may better exclude endocarditis.
.
-Portable CXR ([DATE]): Right main stem bronchus intubation
with collapse of the left lung and mediastinal shift.
.
-Portable CXR ([DATE]): Persistent bibasilar patchy opacities
likely represent pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Left-sided
pleural effusion.
.
-CT C-spine without contrast ([DATE]): 1) [DEIDENTIFIED]-type
fracture of the C1 anterior and posterior arches, and type 2
odontoid fracture, both without significant displacement.
Artifact obscures optimal visualization of the C2 body. Recent
studies from [HOSPITAL] are not
available and comparison with these would be helpful if they can
be scanned into the PACS system. 2) Fusion of the C5-C7
vertebral bodies, likely degenerative in origin. 3) Sphenoid
sinus air-fluid levels, raising the possibility of acute
sinusitis. 4) Small bilateral pleural effusions. 5) Probable
tiny 3 mm nodule at the left lung apex. Comparison with prior
study is recommended.
.
-PICC placement ([DATE]): Via IR guidance.
.
-EGD ([DATE]): Normal mucosa in the esophagus. Abnormal
scarring of distal esophagus, possibly secondary to distant
surgery. Normal mucosa in the stomach. Normal mucosa in the
duodenum. [DEIDENTIFIED] in the stomach. Foreign body, ?guaze in
posterior oropharynx.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE/ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
Patient is an 84 year old female with hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, prior CVAs, prior UGI bleed who presented
with vomiting of coffee ground emesis. No source detected by
EGD and hematocrit stable in MICU. Extubated uneventfully;
remained in cervical collar for recent C1 fracture. Course
complicated by coagulase negative staph bacteremia (3/4 bottles,
with 3 different colonial morphologies) and aspiration
pneumonia. One culture revealed yeast, ([NAME] albicans).
.
.
1) Coagulase negative Staph and [NAME] bacteremia:
[NAME] cultures on [DATE] positive for 3 different strains of
coagulase negative staph species. [NAME] albicans noted in 1
culture bottle as well.
UA negative. Chest Xray reveals aspiration PNA. ID consulted
and thought coagulase negative staph likely secondary to
contamination, but candidemia may not be a contaminant.
-TTE was negative and ophthalmology examination did not reveal
any evidence of chorioretinitis/endophthalmities. As cultures
were positive only on [DEIDENTIFIED], and culture results raised ?of
contaminant, ID did not feel that TEE was necessary. Will
discharge patient on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and fluconazole.
PICC placed on [DEIDENTIFIED] via IR after >72 hour culture negativity.
Vancomycin 750mg twice a day will continue for two week course,
scheduled to end on [DEIDENTIFIED]. Daily trough levels should be drawn,
with goal trough levels (before morning vancomycin dose) between
15-20). Will continue on two week course of fluconazole, 200mg
every day, scheduled to stop on [DEIDENTIFIED]. (Doses adjusted for
mildly diminished CrCl given age). Follow up liver function
testing should occur on fluconazole. Levofloxacin, 750mg every
other day will continue through [DEIDENTIFIED] for aspiration pneumonia.
If fevers or symptoms recur after discontinuation of
antibiotics, cultures should be drawn before any empiric
therapy, and TEE considered at that time.
.
2) Coffee ground emesis:
EGD on [DATE] revealed no active source for upper GI bleed.
Chest xray revealed aspiration pneumonia with bibasilar
infiltrates and left-sided effusion. Patient's hematocrit stable
in the upper 20's to low 30's. Intubated on [DEIDENTIFIED] for airway
protection, as emesis in trachea, but quickly extubated.
Received two units of [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED]. In the past, two previous
EGDs, last one month ago that was negative. No esophageal
varices noted. Foreign body in oropharynx seen at EGD on [DATE]
and subsequently removed by ENT. GI consulted and do not
recommend any further studies as an inpatient (i.e. capsule or
push enteroscopy).
-On discharge, will continue PPI. Hematocrit stable in high
20's.
-After consultation with GI team, restarted plavix on [DEIDENTIFIED] (OK'd
by GI) and will monitor for any evidence of GI bleeding.
.
3) Hypercholestrolemia/CVA:
Will continue on simvastatin. Restarted plavix on [DATE] as no
further evidence of GI bleeding, after consultation with GI.
.
4) C1 fracture:
Sustained following a fall one week prior to admission. Imaging
at [HOSPITAL] showed 3 fractures within the C1 ring and a fracture at
the base of the odontoid. Discharged from [HOSPITAL] [DATE].
Conservatively managed with cervical collar. CT C-spine [DATE]
showed essentially [NAME] [DEIDENTIFIED] fracture and fracture
through the odontoid process, with no dispacement.
-Orthopedics spine team recommended [DEIDENTIFIED] J cervical collar for
four more weeks. No surgical intervention indicated at this
time. Arranged follow up in four weeks with Dr. [NAME]
([NAME], patient can resume activity, as
tolerated, if cervical collar remains in place.
-CT head without contrast on [DEIDENTIFIED] revealed no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage.
-Follow up c-spine CT following ETT and EGD done for review by
ortho spine prior to discharge to ensure neck stability
following procedures.
.
5) Hypertension:
[DEIDENTIFIED] pressure remained stable. Continue on diltiazem 60 mg PO
QID, but switched to longacting diltiazem 240ER.
.
6) Parkinsons Disease:
-Will continue on outpatient Sinemet.
.
7) Hypothyroidism:
-Will continue outpatient levoxyl.
.
8) Questionable left apical pulmonary nodule:
Noted on CT scan during admission. Patient will need follow up
in three months, as noted on CT scan.
.
9) FEN:
Continue on thin liquids and soft consistency solids. Evaluated
by speech and swallow.
.
10) Prophylaxis:
Continue on PPI, heparin SC, and bowel regimen.

Recent Cardiac cath [DATE] showed diffuse 3 vessel disease,
severe mitral regurgitation, and mild systolic and diastolic
ventricular dysfunction. ECHO [DATE] also showed severe MR [NAME] [NAME]y reduced LV and RV systolic function. Pt is followed by
Dr. [HOSPITAL], and is to get repeat

varices (to have repeat EGD [DATE] after recent banding), and
once her R axillary LAD etiology is determined (had negative
dissection with bx 1y PTA, was to have another recently but did
not make the appt because of her current illness.
Pt was admitted to the MICU as she was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR, tachypnic, confused, and with a new renal

Echo [DATE]-There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include basal to mid inferior and distal septal hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (tape not available) of [DATE],
overall left ventricular systolic function is probably similar
(however distal septal hypokinesis noted in the current study
but not in the prior report). Mitral regurgitation is now less
prominent. There is now a restrictive left ventricular filling
pattern.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 69 yo female with h/o 3VD CAD, s/p CABG in [YEAR] and
awaiting repeat, mixed systolic/diastolic CHF with EF 40-45%,
who presents with 10 days of progressive dyspnea, found to have
a fib with RVR, ARF, and increased ascites. She is s/p
cardioversion with ibutilide and had an EP ablation.
1. Cardiovascular:
a. [NAME] Pt was in Afib/Aflut and is s/p ibutilide conversion
to sinus rhythm when she was in the ICU. She was being rate
controlled with PO metoprolol which was being uptitrated but she
went back in to aflutter with RVR on HD 10. She maintained her
pressure and was put on a diltiazem drip, uptitrated to 15
units/hour. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus on HD 12
and had an EP study with ablation that day. Metoprolol was
continued and she was discharged on 50 mg tid.
It was decided not to anticoagulate this patient with varices
after speaking with liver as she is an extreme risk of bleeding.
b. CAD- known 3VD. Pt had new inferolateral ST depressions which
got better on subsequent EKGs. We continued ASA and beta
blocker.
c. Pump/BP- Known mixed systolic, diastolic heart failure.
Repeat echo here showed EF 40-45%. Additionally, it appeared on
physical exam and based on chest xray with b/l pleural effusions
that pt was in CHF exacerbation likely secondary to the RVR. She
was diuresed 1-2 L/day with lasix and her spironolactone was
initially held but slowly uptitrated. While she was in rapid
afib, diuresis was held as we wanted to maintain her pressures.
Hydralazine and isosorbide were held as pressures were
borderline and we wanted to diurese her. Isosorbide was able to
be restarted post-ablation. Strict I/Os were kept, pt was on a
fluid restriction, and a low sodium diet. Wt on discharge was
61.5 kg and likely represents her dry weight.
2. ARF-baseline cr 0.9-1.0, was 3.0 at peak and slowly came
down. It was thought to be a prerenal state from CHF, less
likely afib with RVR as time correlation between the two was a
few days to resolve. Urine Eos were negative, and C3 was normal
therefore it unlikely artheroembolic. Renal u/s showed no
evidence of obstruction or hydronephrosis. As pt was diuresed,
her creatinine came down. On discharge her creatinine was
1.5-1.7 and this likely represents a new baseline for her.
3. [NAME] Pt was dyspneic in the first half of her
hospitalization. It was likely [DEIDENTIFIED] CHF, anxiety, worsening
ascites. As she was diuresed, and with ativan, pt became less
dyspneic. Also, at the end of hospitalization, pt was ambulation
and satting in the mid-upper 90s.
4. Leukocytosis- Peak WBC of 18.8 and Low grade temperatures in
upper 99s. There were no signs of infection and pt was
pancultured multiple times. U/As were negative. BCx x 2 were
negative, UCx were negative.
5. Hepatology/[NAME] Pt with [NAME] vein thrombosis that is
chronic. We did not anticoagulate her afib/flutte [DEIDENTIFIED] varices,
and an extremely high risk of bleeding. Aldactone was initially
held when pt went back in to afib/flutter which was restarted
and uptitrated after the EP ablation. In terms of varices,
stools were gauaiced and negative. An active T&S was kept at all
times. Sucralfate and PPI were continued. She will need repeat
banding as an outpt.
6. Anemia- As above. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of
chronic disease (Iron 12, TIBC, ferritin nl). Pt was given 2
units of pRBC, one each on HD6 and HD 7.
7. F/E/N-renal, cardiac, low salt diet. Electrolytes were
checked and repleted prn.
8. Prophylaxis-Pt was on pneumoboots (given risk of bleeding),
PPI, sucralfate
9. Access- 2 PIVs.
10. [NAME] Pt was Full Code.

History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [NAME] is a 76 year old male with CAD, HTN, asthma, gout
TIA, CKD (baseline 1.8) who was doing well until 10 days ago. He
had right abdominal pimple that grew in size until ED
presentation on [DATE] which led to I&D and discharge with
Bactrime. He saw his PCP [NAME] [DATE]. He reports since
starting Bactrim on [DATE] he has had nausea and abdominal
discomfort so he stopped taking it yesterday. He reported
feeling dizzy for past two days. He was seen today by his PCP
for nausea, weakness and malaise for which electrolytes were
done. On these labs, a K was reported to be 7.2 with Cr of 3.5.
Thus the patient was sent to ED for evaluation.
In ED, initial VS were: 97.7 65 130/55 17 97%. EKG reported
showed peaked T waves and patient was given Calcium gluconate,
insulin/D50 and kayexalate. CXR was completed and was otherwise
unremarkable. He was given 1LNS. Repeat K initially was 3.8
however another sample taken at the same time was 6.6. Decision
was then made to admit patient to MICU for close monitoring.
On arrival to the MICU, he reports no complaints except urge for
bowel movement.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [DATE]
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. The
lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, effusion or
pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and normal. Bony
structures are intact though degenerative changes at both AC
joints are noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute findings in the chest.
Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyperkalemia in setting of [NAME]: Due to perfect storm of volume
depletion from poor oral intake and vomiting with GI side effect
of Bactrim, inability to physiologically compensate with
preglomerular effects of Bactrim and postglomerular effects of
ACE-I. Recieved calcium gluconate, kayexale, Insulin and D50 for
mild peaked T waves. Potasium down to 5.8 on [DEIDENTIFIED] labs and 5.4
when he was transferred from MICU to floor where pt received
albuterol and calcium gluconate for presistent peaked T waves on
EKG. Also received another dose of kayexalate. On [DEIDENTIFIED], K
measured at 4.9 and 4.6. EP EKG showed normalization of peaked T
waves.
# [NAME]: No admitted with a creatinine of 3.9; his baseline is
1.8. Cause of baseline CKD is unknown to the patient. CKD likely
due to both volume depletion and Bactrim toxicity. Creatinine
return to baseline with hydration and discontinuation of
Bactrim.
# Hypertension: Held lisinopril in setting of acute kidney
injury. Continued metoprolol.
# Abdominal wall abscess s/p I&D. His wound looked well drained
with good source control. No indication for antibiotics, so
discontinued doxycycline and clindamycin.
# Gout: Changed allopurinol to 100 mg po qdaily due to [NAME]. Had
not been taking at home because he was confused and thought he
should stop all meds, not just bactrim. started to develop mild
pain in 1st metatarsophalangeal joint on HD3, but pain had
improved by time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [NAME],
You were admitted to the hospital for hyperkalemia (high levels
of potassium in the blood) and for injury to your kidneys. We
believe that both of these problems, along with the nausea and
vomiting you were experiencing, were caused by the antibiotic
you were taking called Bactrim.
To lower the amount of potassium in your blood, we treated you
with kayexalate and with insulin and albuterol. All of these
medications helped to reduced your potassium. Today, your
potassium was back in the normal range.
To treat your kidney injury, we stopped the Bactrim and gave you
fluid through your IV. Today, your blood tests showed that your
kidneys are functioning just as well as they were before you
started taking the Bactrim.
We have made the following changes to your medications:
1. Bactrim - we have stopped this medication.
2. Lisinopril - we have temporarily stopped this medication.
Please discuss when to restart this medication with your primary
care doctor.
We would like you to get your potassium level checked again on
Monday, [DATE]. He had given you a prescription for a blood
test. You can take it to any lab and they will fax the results
to you doctor's office.
Please make a follow-up appointment with your primary care
physician within one week.
Followup Instructions:
Please call to make an appointment with your primary care doctor
within the next week:

History of Present Illness:
82M with hx polycythemia [DOCTOR] (jak2+), afib, hypothyroidism who
presents with increased fatigue and lethargy x several days. The
wife states that at baseline the pt walks with a walker, is
interactive, and feeds himself, early dementia. However for the
past several days he has had decreased appetite, increased
fatigue, and has stopped ambulating. He also became tachypneic,
with wheezing and gasping and so she brought him in to [HOSPITAL]. She denies that the pt had a fever, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or any similar episodes. He does have chills at
baseline and some chronic back pain. She also denies that the
patient complained of chest pain or abdominal pain.
At the [NAME] [NAME] the patietn was found to hav ea BNP >1500, afib
to 110, and expiratory rales improved with ntg, lasix, and O2.
He also had a WBC 40.9. He was transfered to [HOSPITAL] for presumed
new chf/potential cath.
On arrival to [HOSPITAL], the pt was found to be hypotensive,
jaundiced. The ED felt the pt had been overdiuresed so he was
given 2L IVF after which he became more hypoxic requiring 4L nc.
He had sluggish speech, was A&Ox1. Surgery was consulted and did
not feel pt had a surgical issue given benign abdomen. Pt was
given zosyn 4.5mg IV, Vanc 1g IV, and Asa 325mg PR. Repeat labs
showed a WBC 45.3, trop 0.15, Cr 2.5, anion gap 21, mildly
elevated ast/alt, LDH 532, t.bili 7.1. Pt was also found to be
guiaic positive. Pt was admitted to MICU for further work-up.
In the MICU the pt was afebrile, 103/61 82, satting 100% on face
tent. He was in no acute distress but was complained of
weakness. He had a flat affect and responded minimally to
interaction. He denied pain, diaphoresis, sob, n/v.

HCV viral load - HCV RNA detected, less than 43 IU/mL.
 Performed using the Cobas Ampliprep / Cobas Taqman HCV
Test.
 Linear range of quantification: 43 IU/mL - 69 million
IU/mL.
 Limit of detection: 18 IU/mL.
Imaging:
Head CT: [DEIDENTIFIED]
IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or edema.
2. Generalized atrophy, sequelae of chronic small vessel
ischemic disease and
pontine lacunes.
3. Preferential atrophy of the rostral midbrain; this finding
should be
correlated with any history of neurodegenerative disorder, e.g.
progressive
supranuclear palsy.
4. Significant intracranial vascular calcification.
CXR: [DEIDENTIFIED]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
stable evidence of massive bilateral mainly alveolar opacities
with subtle interstitial markings. Moderate cardiomegaly. The
findings have not substantially changed since [DATE].
The findings could represent both pulmonary edema and pneumonia,
or a
combination of both than pneumonia.
[DEIDENTIFIED] Liver Ultrasound :
1. Extensive gallbladder sludge, layering stones without
secondary signs
of cholecystitis, however in the appropriate clinical setting,
acute
cholecystitis is nto excluded.
2. Right pleural effusion.
3. Splenomegaly measuring up to 14.6 cm.
EKG: Afib @94, LAD, poor r-wave prog, TWI I, aVL, V2.
Brief Hospital Course:
82 male with previous history of polycythemia [DOCTOR],
hypertension, Atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, and
hypothyroidism who presented with increased fatigue/lethargy for
several days, with elevated leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin,
and troponin leak concerning for NSTEMI.
# Lethargy/Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with worsening
functional status and energy for several several days. Given
history of polycythemia [DOCTOR] (with JAK2+ mutation) with
increasing WBC, hyperuricemia, elevated LDH, with relative
anemia, concerning for transformation to a leukemic process
(risk factor age >70). However differential did not have
precursor cells so the initial evaluation was not classic for
AML. Patient has a history of hypothyroidism, but TSH was only
slightly elevated, so no evidence of myxedema coma. Patient
likely had an NSTEMI given his troponin leak, which could have
lead to hypoperfusion in setting of MI, acute renal failure, and
elevated liver function tests. No evidence of intracranial acute
process on Head CT. Renal failure likely also contributed to
altered mental status due to uremia. Hematology consult was
obtained, and lab abnormalities were thought to not be due to
leukemic conversion, but rather due to continued hemolysis from
her polycythemia [DOCTOR]. Pt was transferred to the medicine floor
further work-up, but returned to the ICU on [DATE] after
multiple triggers on the floor for worsening respiratory
distress and tachycardia/atrial fibrillation with RVR
unresponsive to IV metoprolol and diltiazem boluses on the
floor, and decreased responsiveness. CT scan did not show any
evidence of RP bleed or decreased hematocrit concerning for
bleed. Overnight in the ICU, he developed multi-organ system
failure with worsening pulmonary infiltrates (pneumonia and
pulmonary interstitial infiltrates) likely in the setting of
cardiogenic shock from her NSTEMI along with liver failure and
renal failure. His multi-organ failure may also have been
induced in the setting of leukostasis and sludging from the
elevated leukocytosis. The family and HCP did not want any
further interventions, so the patient was made DNR/DNI and
comfort measures only. He was given dilaudid and oxygen as
needed for respiratory distress and passed away.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient with peak creatinine of 3.0
during this admission increased from 1.5 a year ago with
worsening anion gap acidosis. Likely in setting of decreased
renal perfusion from NSTEMI. Patient had worsening acute renal
failure during his ICU stay. Due to goals of care, patient was
made DNR/DNI CMO and expired.
# Elevated troponins: Patient likely had NSTEMI. Troponins also
accumulated in setting of renal failure. Enzymes trended 0.15
to peak of 0.8 prior to expiration. TTE showed extensive
regional LV dysfunction, concerning for ischemia/infarction in
the LAD distribution. EF 30-35%. No EKG changes. Cardiology was
consulted and did not think patient was a candidate for cardiac
catherization. Heparin drip started for presumed NSTEMI but was
eventually discontinued when patient was made comfort measures
only and expired.
# Hyperuricemia: Uric acid elevated to 18.6, likely due acute
renal failure versus tumor lysis, versus undiagnosed gout versus
continued lysis of red blood cells from polycythemia [DOCTOR]. IVFs
were given with little improvement. Patient was made
DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Bilirubin on admission noted to be total
7.1, direct 2.5, concerning for hepatic process vs hemolysis.
Hemolysis possible in setting of underlying RBC defect for
Polycythemia [DOCTOR], LDH elevated however haptoglobin was normal,
indicating possible chronic hemolysis. Peripheral smear was
sent but did not show any acute forms concerning for acute
leukemic conversion. RUQ U/S shows sludging but no acute
choleycystitis. Surgery consulted, felt that there was no
surgical process. Bilirubin continued to rise this admission,
also concerning for hypotensive shock in setting of NSTEMI
versus arterial/venous sludging in the liver from leukostasis
given elevated WBC. Patient was made DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was on dabigatran and atenolol at
admission. Dabigatran held on HD #1 due to elevated INR and
likely poor clearance secondary to renal failure. Patient was
made DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.
# Hypothyroid: Continued home synthroid. TSH 7.6, no evidence
of myxedema coma. Patient was made DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.

hypertension, Atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, and
hypothyroidism who presented with increased fatigue/lethargy for
several days, with elevated leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin,
and troponin leak concerning for NSTEMI.
# Lethargy/Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with worsening
functional status and energy for several several days. Given
history of polycythemia [DOCTOR] (with JAK2+ mutation) with
increasing WBC, hyperuricemia, elevated LDH, with relative
anemia, concerning for transformation to a leukemic process
(risk factor age >70). However differential did not have
precursor cells so the initial evaluation was not classic for
AML. Patient has a history of hypothyroidism, but TSH was only
slightly elevated, so no evidence of myxedema coma. Patient
likely had an NSTEMI given his troponin leak, which could have
lead to hypoperfusion in setting of MI, acute renal failure, and
elevated liver function tests. No evidence of intracranial acute
process on Head CT. Renal failure likely also contributed to
altered mental status due to uremia. Hematology consult was
obtained, and lab abnormalities were thought to not be due to
leukemic conversion, but rather due to continued hemolysis from
her polycythemia [DOCTOR]. Pt was transferred to the medicine floor
further work-up, but returned to the ICU on [DATE] after
multiple triggers on the floor for worsening respiratory
distress and tachycardia/atrial fibrillation with RVR
unresponsive to IV metoprolol and diltiazem boluses on the
floor, and decreased responsiveness. CT scan did not show any
evidence of RP bleed or decreased hematocrit concerning for
bleed. Overnight in the ICU, he developed multi-organ system
failure with worsening pulmonary infiltrates (pneumonia and
pulmonary interstitial infiltrates) likely in the setting of
cardiogenic shock from her NSTEMI along with liver failure and
renal failure. His multi-organ failure may also have been
induced in the setting of leukostasis and sludging from the
elevated leukocytosis. The family and HCP did not want any
further interventions, so the patient was made DNR/DNI and
comfort measures only. He was given dilaudid and oxygen as
needed for respiratory distress and passed away.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient with peak creatinine of 3.0
during this admission increased from 1.5 a year ago with
worsening anion gap acidosis. Likely in setting of decreased
renal perfusion from NSTEMI. Patient had worsening acute renal
failure during his ICU stay. Due to goals of care, patient was
made DNR/DNI CMO and expired.
# Elevated troponins: Patient likely had NSTEMI. Troponins also
accumulated in setting of renal failure. Enzymes trended 0.15
to peak of 0.8 prior to expiration. TTE showed extensive
regional LV dysfunction, concerning for ischemia/infarction in
the LAD distribution. EF 30-35%. No EKG changes. Cardiology was
consulted and did not think patient was a candidate for cardiac
catherization. Heparin drip started for presumed NSTEMI but was
eventually discontinued when patient was made comfort measures
only and expired.
# Hyperuricemia: Uric acid elevated to 18.6, likely due acute
renal failure versus tumor lysis, versus undiagnosed gout versus
continued lysis of red blood cells from polycythemia [DOCTOR]. IVFs
were given with little improvement. Patient was made
DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Bilirubin on admission noted to be total
7.1, direct 2.5, concerning for hepatic process vs hemolysis.
Hemolysis possible in setting of underlying RBC defect for
Polycythemia [DOCTOR], LDH elevated however haptoglobin was normal,
indicating possible chronic hemolysis. Peripheral smear was
sent but did not show any acute forms concerning for acute
leukemic conversion. RUQ U/S shows sludging but no acute
choleycystitis. Surgery consulted, felt that there was no
surgical process. Bilirubin continued to rise this admission,
also concerning for hypotensive shock in setting of NSTEMI
versus arterial/venous sludging in the liver from leukostasis
given elevated WBC. Patient was made DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was on dabigatran and atenolol at
admission. Dabigatran held on HD #1 due to elevated INR and
likely poor clearance secondary to renal failure. Patient was
made DNR/DNI/CMO and expired.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [DEIDENTIFIED] F with PMH of dementia, a. fib with tachy-brady
syndrome who was brought in from [HOSPITAL] rehab with 1 week of
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, poor po intake on liquid diet.
She had an ultrasound at [HOSPITAL] Rehab which showed a gallstone
or porcelain gallbladder. She was treated with oxycodone for
pain and zofran for nausea. She developed acute renal failure
with increase in her creatinine to 3.13 on [DEIDENTIFIED]. She was given
IVF and her torsemide dose was increased. She initially had a Do
Not Hospitalize order but after discussion with the daugher and
HCP, this was reversed.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 96.3 P 45 (30-70) 150/98 16 89% on
RA. Her BP dropped to 56-64 systolic, on recheck was 90/doppler
in L arm, 70/doppler in R arm. BP remained 87/60 after 4L NS and
she was started on levophed drip. Exam showed RUQ abdominal
pain. Her EKG showed afib rvr @ 116, no ischemic change. Stools
were guaiac positive. She was given ceftriaxone and flagyl. CXR
was neg for pna. Pelvic films showed no fx. She was seen by
surgery who recommended zosyn and ERCP eval as HCP does not want
surgery. VS prior to transfer were T 95, P: 107, BP: 117/99, RR:
23, 95% on RA
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was comfortable. She was
complaining of mild nausea but no abdominal pain at rest.

Micro- Blood cx pending, negative to date
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [DEIDENTIFIED] F with PMH of dementia, a. fib with tachy-brady
syndrome with 1 week of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, was
found to have RUQ pain, gallstones with possible
choledocholithiasis.
.
#Hypotension: Now resolved. Patient presented with RUQ pain,
findings of choledocholithiasis, hypotension and hypothermia.
Patient was volume resuscitated in the ED with 4 L NS. Her
hypotension was likely worsened by her tachy-brady syndrome and
her history of baseline relative hypotension/dehydration.
Suspicion for sepsis was low given the resolved hypotension in
less than 12 hours, no fevers, no leukocytosis or infection
localized. Could also be related to hypovolemia and tachycardia
causing hypotension. Zosyn for choledocholithiasis has been
discontinued
given very low clinical suspicion for cholangitis.BCx, UCx ??????
pending and negative to date.
.
# Abdominal pain: likely secondary to chololithiasis given RUQ
US that showed porcelain gallbladder, intra and extrahepatic
biliary dilation, with CBD measuring up to 17 mm along with RUQ
pain and positive [DOCTOR] sign. These changes however were felt
to be more chronic in nature than acute given normal LFT's.
Would expect her LFTs to be more elevated if gallbladder was
etiology of septic shock and WBC also remains normal. Family is
against any surgical intervention at this time but open to ERCP.
 Could be more of a chronic biliary process given porcelain
gallbladder and normal labs, such as a pancreatic or biliary
malignancy. No acute indication for ERCP
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's creatinine peaked at
3.13 on [DEIDENTIFIED], now sl improved at 2.0 with IVF. ARF likely
secondary to poor po intake in the setting of sepsis and
infection. Resolved with fluids to a creatinine of 2.0.
.
#Elevated troponin: also associated with TWI which are resolved
and CE trending down. Patient denies CP currently.Per patient
has had chest pain intermittently for over 20 years. Likely
related to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and
tachycardia when the patient was off beta blockade at the
beginning of the admission.
Repeat ECG [DEIDENTIFIED] revealed no new ischemic changes trop
downtrending from 0.09 to 0.07 and negative CK-MB. Continued
home aspirin 325 mg po daily. Restarted Metoprolol after
hypotension resolved and patient's heart rate stabilized around
100-110.
.
# Macrocytic Anemia: HCT 28.8 sl lower than prior of 34 in [YEAR]
though unclear recent baseline. HCT 26.5-> 25.4 after 4 L NS
likely from hemodilution.Hct stabilized around 26. Continue PPI
for now, will discontinue on discharge to rehab given low
suspicion for gastric ulcer or bleed.Vitamin B12 and Folate
were normal and not iron deficient.
.
#Dementia: Patient has dementia at baseline and is not oriented
to time. She continues to have agitation and is trying to get
out of bed but can reorient. Reoriented frequently. Haldol prn
agitation
# Communication: Daughter
# Code: DNR/DNI confirmed with Ludmila Dymina [PHONE]
# Disposition: back to rehab.

It was a pleasure to care for you as your doctor.
.
You were brought to the hospital because of low blood pressures
and high heart rate which we felt was due to dehydration and a
underlying arrythmia which you have. Your low blood pressure
resolved with fluids and your high heart rate improved with the
medication named Metoprolol. [NAME] signs of infection was found in
your urine or blood. An ultrasound of your liver showed dilated
gall bladder which most likely represents a chronic process of
unknown etiology.
.
There was no changes made to your home medication list.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 96.3 P 45 (30-70) 150/98 16 89% on
RA. Her BP dropped to 56-64 systolic, on recheck was 90/doppler
in L arm, 70/doppler in R arm. BP remained 87/60 after 4L NS and
she was started on levophed drip. Exam showed RUQ abdominal
pain. Her EKG showed afib rvr @ 116, no ischemic change. Stools
were guaiac positive. She was given ceftriaxone and flagyl. CXR
was neg for pna. Pelvic films showed no fx. She was seen by
surgery who recommended zosyn and ERCP eval as HCP does not want
surgery. VS prior to transfer were T 95, P: 107, BP: 117/99, RR:

On arrival to the MICU, patient was comfortable. She was
complaining of mild nausea but no abdominal pain at rest.","1","Patient is a [DEIDENTIFIED] F with PMH of dementia, a. fib with tachy-brady

#Hypotension: Now resolved. Patient presented with RUQ pain,
findings of choledocholithiasis, hypotension and hypothermia.
Patient was volume resuscitated in the ED with 4 L NS. Her
hypotension was likely worsened by her tachy-brady syndrome and
her history of baseline relative hypotension/dehydration.
Suspicion for sepsis was low given the resolved hypotension in
less than 12 hours, no fevers, no leukocytosis or infection
localized. Could also be related to hypovolemia and tachycardia
causing hypotension. Zosyn for choledocholithiasis has been
discontinued
given very low clinical suspicion for cholangitis.BCx, UCx ??????
pending and negative to date.
.
# Abdominal pain: likely secondary to chololithiasis given RUQ
US that showed porcelain gallbladder, intra and extrahepatic
biliary dilation, with CBD measuring up to 17 mm along with RUQ
pain and positive [DOCTOR] sign. These changes however were felt
to be more chronic in nature than acute given normal LFT's.
Would expect her LFTs to be more elevated if gallbladder was
etiology of septic shock and WBC also remains normal. Family is
against any surgical intervention at this time but open to ERCP.
 Could be more of a chronic biliary process given porcelain
gallbladder and normal labs, such as a pancreatic or biliary
malignancy. No acute indication for ERCP
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's creatinine peaked at
3.13 on [DEIDENTIFIED], now sl improved at 2.0 with IVF. ARF likely
secondary to poor po intake in the setting of sepsis and
infection. Resolved with fluids to a creatinine of 2.0.
.
#Elevated troponin: also associated with TWI which are resolved
and CE trending down. Patient denies CP currently.Per patient
has had chest pain intermittently for over 20 years. Likely
related to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and
tachycardia when the patient was off beta blockade at the
beginning of the admission.
Repeat ECG [DEIDENTIFIED] revealed no new ischemic changes trop
downtrending from 0.09 to 0.07 and negative CK-MB. Continued
home aspirin 325 mg po daily. Restarted Metoprolol after
hypotension resolved and patient's heart rate stabilized around
100-110.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IJ Central line placement HPI: Patient is a [DEIDENTIFIED] F with PMH of dementia, a. fib with tachy-brady
syndrome who was brought in from [HOSPITAL] rehab with 1 week of
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, poor po intake on liquid diet.
She had an ultrasound at [HOSPITAL] Rehab which showed a gallstone
or porcelain gallbladder. She was treated with oxycodone for
pain and zofran for nausea. She developed acute renal failure
with increase in her creatinine to 3.13 on [DEIDENTIFIED]. She was given
IVF and her torsemide dose was increased. She initially had a Do
Not Hospitalize order but after discussion with the daugher and
HCP, this was reversed.
