The label binarization (multi-hot encoding) code?

A basic NLP model pipeline (TF-IDF + LogisticRegression)?

A transformer (like BERT) pipeline for this?

converting icd9_codes into binary vectors

cleaning the summary_snippet text

starting an NLP model (e.g., scikit-learn or HuggingFace Transformers)

Help write the preprocessing & label binarization code?

Suggest an architecture (like BERT for multi-label text classification)?

Save the result as a .csv file for inspection?

Preprocess the summary_snippet

Clean text, remove headers if needed

Tokenize or use a transformer (e.g., BERT, BioClinicalBERT)

Convert icd9_codes to binary multi-hot encoding

Build a vocabulary of ICD-9 codes

Convert each label list to a binary vector

Train a multi-label classifier

You can use scikit-learn (OneVsRestClassifier), or Transformers + sigmoid output + BCEWithLogits loss
